<p class="pp6 p1"><i>O Mourner in the silence of the hills,<br />
O Thing of ancient griefs, art thou a wolf?<br />
I heard a cry that shook me&mdash;was it thine?</i></p>

<p class="pp6 p1"><i>Low in the mystic purple of the west<br />
The weird moon hangs, a tarnished silver slug:<br />
Vast, vast the hollow empty night curves down,<br />
Stabbed with the glass-like glinting of the stars,<br />
And, save when that wild cry grows up anon,<br />
No sound but this dull murmur of the hush&mdash;<br />
The winter hush.</i></p>

<p class="pp10 p1"><i>Hark! once again thy cry!</i></p>
<p class="pp6"><i>Thy strange, sharp, ice-like, tenuous complaint,<br />
As though the spirit of this frozen waste<br />
Pinched with the cruel frost yearned summerward!</i></p>

<p class="pp6 p1"><i>I know thou art a wolf that criest so:<br />
Though hidden in the shadow, I can see<br />
Thy four feet huddled in the numbing frost,<br />
Thy snout, breath-whitened, pointing to the sky:<br />
Poor pariah of the plains, I know ’tis thou.</i></p>

<p class="pp6 p1"><i>And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I heard a kinsman shout!<br />
Down through the intricate centuries it came,<br />
A far-blown cry! From old-world graves it grew,<br />
Up through the tumbled walls of ancient realms,<br />
Up through the lizard-haunted heaps of stone,<br />
Up through the choking ashes of old fanes,<br />
The pitiful debris where Grandeur dwelt,<br />
Out of the old-world wilderness it grew&mdash;<br />
The cry I know! And I have heard my Kin!</i></p>

<p class="pch">THE ALIEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THROUGH the quiet night, crystalline with
the pervading spirit of the frost, under
prairie skies of mystic purple pierced with
the glass-like glinting of the stars, fled Antoine.</p>

<p>Huge and hollow-sounding with the clatter of the
pinto’s hoofs hung the night above and about&mdash;lonesome,
empty, bitter as the soul of him who fled.</p>

<p>A weary age of flight since sunset; and now the
midnight saw the thin-limbed, long-haired pony
slowly losing his nerve, tottering, rasping in the
throat. With pitiless spike-spurred heels the rider
hurled the beast into the empty night.</p>

<p>“Gwan! you blasted cayuse! you overgrown wolf-dog!
you pot-bellied shonga! Keep up that tune;
I’m goin’ somewheres. What’d I steal you fer?
Pleasure? He, he, he, ho, ho, ho! I reckon; pleasure
for the half-breed! Gwan!”</p>

<p>Suddenly rounding a bank of sand, the pinto
sighted the broad, ice-bound river, an elysian stream
of glinting silver under the stars. Sniffing and
crouching upon its haunches at the sudden glow that
dwindled a gleaming thread into the further dusk,
the jaded beast received a series of vicious jabs from
the spike-spurred heels. It groaned and lunged forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
again, taking with uncertain feet the glaring
path ahead, and awakening dull, snarling thunder in
the under regions of the ice. Slipping, struggling,
doing its brute best to overcome fatigue and the uncertainty
of its path, the pinto covered the ice.</p>

<p>“Doin’ a war dance, eh?” growled the man with
bitter mirth, and gouging the foaming bloody flanks
of the animal. “Gwan! Set up that tune; I want
fast music, ’cause I’m goin’ somewheres&mdash;don’t know
where&mdash;somewheres out there in the shadders! Come
here, will you? Take that and that and <i>that</i>! Now
will you kick the scen’ry back’ards? By the&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>The brutal cries of the man were cut short as he
shot far over the pommel, lunging headlong over the
pinto’s head, and striking with head and shoulders
upon the glare ice. When he stopped sliding he lay
very still for a few moments. Then he groaned,
sat up, and found that the bluffs and the river and the
stars and the universe in general were whirling giddily,
with himself for the dizzy centre.</p>

<p>With uncertain arms he reached out, endeavouring
to check the sickening motion of things with the sheer
force of his powerful hands. He was thrown down
like a weakling wrestling with a giant. He lay still,
cursing in a whisper, trying to steady the universe,
until the motion passed, leaving in his nerves the
sickening sensation incident to the sudden ending of a
rapid flight.</p>

<p>With great care Antoine raised himself upon his
elbows and gazed about with an imbecile leer. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he began to remember; remembered that he was
hunted; that he was an outcast, a man of no race;
remembered dimly, and with a malignant grin, a portion
of a long series of crimes; remembered that the
last was horse-stealing and that some of the others
concerned blood. And as he remembered, he felt
with horrible distinctness the lariat tightening about
his neck&mdash;the lariat that the men of Cabanne’s trading
post were bringing on fleet horses, nearer, nearer,
nearer through the silent night.</p>

<p>Antoine shuddered and got to his feet, looming
huge against the star-sprent surface of the ice, as he
turned a face of bestial malevolence down trail and
listened for the beat of hoofs. There was only the
dim, hollow murmur that dwells at the heart of
silence.</p>

<p>“Got a long start,” he observed, with the chuckle
of a man whom desperation has made careless.
“Hel-<i>lo</i>!”</p>

<p>A pale, semicircular glow, like the flare of a burning
straw stack a half day’s journey over the hills,
had grown up at the horizon of the east; and as the
man stared, still in a maze from his recent fall, the
moon heaved a tarnished silver arc above the mystic
rim of sky, flooding with new light the river and the
bluffs. The man stood illumined&mdash;a big brute of a
man, heavy-limbed, massive-shouldered, with the
slouching stoop and the alert air of an habitual
skulker. He moved uneasily, as though he had
suddenly become visible to some lurking foe. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
glanced nervously about him, fumbled at the butt
of a six-shooter at his belt, then catching sight of
the blotch of huddled dusk that was the fallen pinto,
the meaning of the situation flashed upon him.</p>

<p>“That cussed cayuse! Gone and done hisself like
as not! Damn me! the whole creation’s agin
me!”</p>

<p>He made for the pony, snarling viciously as though
its exhausted, lacerated self were the visible body of
the inimical universe. He grasped the reins and
jerked them violently. The brute only groaned and
let its weary head fall heavily upon the ice.</p>

<p>“<i>Get up!</i>”</p>

<p>Antoine began kicking the pony in the ribs, bringing
forth great hollow bellowings of pain.</p>

<p>“O, you won’t get up, eh? Agin me too, eh? Take
that, and that and <i>that</i>! I wished you was everybody
in the whole world and hell to oncet, I’d make you
beller now I got you down! Take <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>The man with a roar of anger fell upon the pony,
snarling, striking, kicking, but the pony only groaned.
Its limbs could no longer support its body. When
Antoine had exhausted his rage, he got up, gave the
pony a parting kick on the nose, and started off at
a dogtrot across the glinting ice towards the bluffs
beyond.</p>

<p>Ever and anon he stopped and whirled about with
hand at ear. He heard only the sullen murmur of
the silence, broken occasionally by the whine and pop
of the ice and the plaintive, bitter wail of the coyotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
somewhere in the hills, like the heartbroken cry of
the lonesome prairie, yearning for the summer.</p>

<p>“O, I wouldn’t howl if I was you,” muttered the
man to the coyotes; “I wished I was a coyote or a
grey wolf, knowin’ what I do. I’d be a man-killer
and a cattle-killer, I would. And then I’d have people
of my own. Wouldn’t be no cur of a half-breed
runnin’ from his kind. O, I wouldn’t howl if I was
you!”</p>

<p>He proceeded at a swinging trot across the half
mile of ice and halted under the bluffs. He listened
intently. A far sound had grown up in the hollow
night&mdash;vague, but unmistakable. It was the clatter
of hoofs far away, but clear in faintness, for the cold
snap had made the prairie one vast sounding-board.
A light snow had fallen the night before, and the
trail of the refugee was traced in the moonlight, distinct
as a wagon track.</p>

<p>Antoine felt the pitiless pinch of the approaching
lariat as he listened. Then his accustomed bitter
weariness of life came upon the pariah.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of me runnin’? What am I runnin’
to? Nothin’&mdash;only more of the same thing I’m
runnin’ from; lonesomeness and hunger and the like
of that. Gettin’ awake stiff and cold and half starved
and cussin’ the daylight ’cause it’s agin me like everything
else, and gives me away. Sneakin’ around in
the brush till dark, eatin’ when I can like a damned
wolf, then goin’ to sleep hopin’ it’ll never get day.
But it always does. It’s all night somewheres, I guess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
spite of what the missionaries says. That’s fer me&mdash;night
always! No comin’ day, no gettin’ up, somewhere
to hide snug in always!”</p>

<p>He walked on with head dropped forward upon
his breast, skirting the base of the bluffs, now seemingly
oblivious of the sound of hoofs that grew momently
more distinct.</p>

<p>As he walked, he was dimly conscious of passing
the dark mouth of a hole running back into the clay
of a bluff. He proceeded until he found himself
again at the edge of the river, staring down into a
broad, black fissure in the ice, caused, doubtless, by
the dash of the current crossing from the other side.</p>

<p>A terrible, dark, but alluring thought seized him.
Here was the place&mdash;the doorway to that place
where it was always night! Why not go in? There
would be no more running away, no more hiding, no
more hatred of men, no more lonesomeness! Here
was the place at last.</p>

<p>He stepped forward and stooped to gaze down into
the door of night. The rushing waters made a dismal,
moaning sound.</p>

<p>He stared transfixed. Yes, he would go!</p>

<p>Suddenly a shudder ran through his limbs. He
gave a quick exclamation of terror! He leaped back
and raised his face to the skies.</p>

<p>How kind and soft and gentle and good to look
upon was the sky! He gazed about&mdash;it was so fair
a world! How good it was to breathe! He longed
to throw his great, brute arms about creation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
clutch it to him, and hold it, hold it, hold it! He
wished to live.</p>

<p><i>The hoofs!</i></p>

<p>The distant muffled confusion of sound had grown
into sharp, distinct, staccato notes. The pursuers
were now less than a mile away. Soon they would
reach the river.</p>

<p>With the quick instinct of the hunted beast, Antoine
knew the means of safety. His footprints led
to the ice-fissure. He decided that none should lead
away. He could not be pursued under ice. Stooping
so that he could look between his legs, he began retracing
his steps, walking backward, placing his feet
with infinite care where they had fallen before. Thus
he came again to the hole in the clay bluff, and disappeared.
His trail had passed within a foot of the
hole, which was overhung by a jutting point of sandstone.
No snow had fallen at the entrance; he left
no trail as he entered.</p>

<p>Stopping upon his hands and knees, he listened and
could hear distinctly the sharp crack of hoofs upon the
ice and the pop and thunder of the frozen surface.</p>

<p>“Here’s <i>some</i> luck,” muttered Antoine. He
crawled on into the nether darkness of the hole that
grew more spacious as he proceeded. As he crawled,
the sound of pursuing hoofs grew dimmer. Antoine
half forgot them. His keen sense had caught the
peculiar musty odour of animal life. He felt a stuffy
warmth in his nostrils as he breathed.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the dark ahead grew up two points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of phosphorescent light. Antoine fell back upon his
haunches with a little growl of surprise in his throat.
Years of wild lonesome life had made him more beast
than man.</p>

<p>The lights slowly came closer, growing more brilliant.
Then there was a harsh, rasping growl and a
sound of sniffing. Antoine waited until the expanding
pupils of his eyes could grasp the situation with
more distinctness. “Can’t run,” he mused. “Lariat
behind, somethin’ growlin’ in front. It’s one more
fight. Here goes fer my damnedest. Rather die
mad and fightin’ than jump into cold water or stick
my head through a rawhide necktie!”</p>

<p>He crawled on carefully. The lights approached
with a strange swaying motion. Then of a sudden
came a whine, a sharp, savage yelp, and Antoine felt
his cheek ripped open with a stroke of gnashing
teeth!</p>

<p>He felt for an instant the hot breath of the beast,
the trickle of hot blood on his cheek; and then all
that was human in him passed. He growled and
hurled the sinewy body of his unseen foe from him
with a blow of his bear-like paw. He was a big man,
and in his blood the primitive beast had grown large
through long years of lonesome hiding from his
kind.</p>

<p>The dark hole echoed a muffled howl of anger, and
in an instant man and beast rolled together in the
darkness. It was a primitive struggle; the snapping
of jaws, the rasping of hoarse throats that laboured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with angry breath, snarlings of hate, yelps of pain,
growls, whines.</p>

<p>At last the man knew that it was a grey wolf he
fought. He reached for its throat, but felt his hand
caught in a hot, wet, powerful trap of teeth. He
grasped the under jaw with a grip that made his antagonist
howl with pain. Then with his other hand
he felt about in the darkness, groping for the throat.</p>

<p>He found it, seized it with a vice-like clutch, shut
his teeth together, and threw all of the power of his
massive frame into the struggle.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, the struggles of the wolf became
weaker. The lean, hairy form fell limply, and the
man laughed with a strange, sobbing, guttural mirth&mdash;for
he was master.</p>

<p>Then again he felt the trickle of blood upon his
cheek, the ache of his bitten hand. His anger returned
with double fury. He kicked the limp body
as he lay beside it, never releasing his grip.</p>

<p>Suddenly he forgot to kick. There were sounds!
He heard the <i>thump thump</i> of hoofs passing his place
of refuge. Then they ceased. There were sounds of
voices coming dimly; then after a while the hoofs
passed again, and there was a voice that said “saved
hangin’ anyway.”</p>

<p>The hoof beats grew dimmer, and Antoine knew
by their hollow sound that his pursuers had begun to
cross the ice on the back trail. He again gave his
attention to the wolf. It lay very still. A feeling
of supreme comfort came over Antoine. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sweet to be a master. He laid his head upon the
wolf’s motionless body. He was very weary, he had
conquered, and he would sleep upon his prey.</p>

<p>He awoke feeling a warm, rasping something upon
his wounded cheek. A faint light came in at the
entrance of the place. It was morning. In his sleep
Antoine had moved his head close to the muzzle of
the wolf. Now, utterly conquered, bruised, unable
to arise, the brute was feebly licking the blood from
the man’s wound.</p>

<p>Antoine’s sense of mastery after his sound sleep
made him kind for once. He was safe and something
had caressed him, altho’ it was only a soundly-beaten
wolf.</p>

<p>“You pore devil!” said Antoine with a sudden
softness in his voice; “I done you up, didn’t I? You
hain’t so bad, I guess; but if I hadn’t done you, I’d
got done myself. Hurt much, you pore devil, eh?”</p>

<p>He stroked the side of the animal, whereupon it
cried out with pain.</p>

<p>“Pretty sore, eh? Well as long as I’m bigger’n
you, I’ll be good to you, I will. I ain’t so bad, am
I? You treat me square and you won’t never get no
bad deals from the half-breed; mind that. Hel-<i>lo</i>!
you’re a <i>Miss</i> Wolf, ain’t you? Well, for the present,
I’m a Mister Wolf, and I’m a good un! Let me
hunt you up a name; somethin’ soft like a woman,
’cause you did touch me kind of tender like. <i>Susette!</i>&mdash;that’s
it&mdash;<i>Susette</i>. You’re Susette now. I hain’t
got no people, so I’m a wolf from now on, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
name’s Antoine. Susette and Antoine&mdash;sounds pretty
good, don’t it? Say, I know as much about bein’ a
wolf as you do. Can’t teach me nothin’ about sneakin’
and hidin’ and fightin’! Say, old girl, <i>hain’t</i> I a
tol’able good fighter now? O, I know I am, and
when you need it again, you’re goin’ to get it good
and hard, Susette; mind that. Hain’t got nothin’ to
eat about the house, have you, old girl? Then, bein’
head of the family with a sick woman about, I’m
goin’ huntin’. Don’t you let no other wolf come
skulkin’ around! You know me! I’ll wear his skin
when I come back, if you don’t mind!”</p>

<p>And he went out.</p>

<p>Before noon he returned bringing three jack rabbits,
having shot them with his six-shooter. “Well,
Susette,” said he, “got any appetite?”</p>

<p>He passed his hand over the wolf’s snout caressingly.
The wolf flinched in fear, but the man continued
his caresses until she licked his hand.</p>

<p>“Now we’re friends and we can live together
peaceable, can’t we? Took a big family row, though.
Families needs stirrin’ up now and then, I reckon.”</p>

<p>He skinned a rabbit and cut off morsels of meat.</p>

<p>“Here, Susette, I’m goin’ to fill your hide first,
’cause you’ve been so good since the row that I’m
half beginnin’ to love you a little. There, that’s it&mdash;eat.
Does me good to see you eat, pore, sick
Susette!”</p>

<p>The wolf took the morsels from his hand and a
look almost tame came into her eyes. When she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
eaten a rabbit, Antoine had a meal of raw flesh. Then
he sat down beside her and stroked her nose and neck
and flanks. There was an air of home about the
place. He was safe and sheltered, had a full stomach,
and there was a fellow creature near him that showed
kindness, altho’ it had been won with a beating. But
this man had long been accustomed to possessing by
violence, and he was satisfied.</p>

<p>“Susette,” he said in a soft voice; “don’t get mean
again when you get well. I want to live quiet and
like somethin’ that likes me oncet. If you’ll be good,
I’ll get you rabbits and antelope and birds, and you
won’t need to hunt no more nor go about with your
belly flappin’ together. And I know how to make fire&mdash;somethin’
you don’t know, wise as you be; and I’ll
keep you warm and pet you.</p>

<p>“Is it a bargain? All you need to do is just be
good, keepin’ your teeth out’n my cheek. I’ve been
lonesome always. I hain’t got no people. Do you
know who your dad was, Susette? Neither do I.
Some French trader was mine, I guess. We’re in the
same boat there. My mother was an Omaha. O
Susette, I know what it means to set a stranger in my
mother’s lodge. ‘<i>Wagah peazzha!</i>’ [no good
white man], that’s what the Omahas called me ever
since I was a little feller. And the white men said
‘damn Injun.’ And where am I? O, hangin’ onto
the edge of things, gettin’ ornry and nasty and bad!
I’ve stole horses and killed people and cussed fer
days, Susette. And I want to rest; I want to love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
somethin’. Cabanne’s men down at the post would
laugh to hear me sayin’ that. But I do. I want to
love somethin’. Tried to oncet; her name was
Susette, jest like your’n. She was a trader’s daughter&mdash;a
pretty French girl. That was before I got
bad. I talked sweet to her like I’m a talkin’ to you,
and she kind of liked it. But the old man Lecroix&mdash;that
was her dad&mdash;he showed me the trail and he
says: ‘Go that way and go fast, you damn Injun!’</p>

<p>“I went, Susette, but I made him pay, I did. I
seen him on his back a-grinnin’ straight up at the
stars; and since then I hain’t cared much. I killed
several after that, and I called ’em all Lecroix!</p>

<p>“Be a good girl, Susette, and I’ll stick to you. I’m
a good fighter, you know, and I’m a good grub-hunter,
too. I learned all that easy.”</p>

<p>He continued caressing the wolf, and she licked his
hand when he stroked her muzzle.</p>

<p>Days passed; the winter deepened; the heavy snows
came. Antoine nursed his bruised companion back
to health. Through the bitter nights he kept a fire
burning at the entrance of the hole. The depth of
the snow made it improbable that any should learn
his whereabouts; and by that time the news must have
spread from post to post that Antoine, the outlaw
half-breed, had drowned himself in the ice-fissure.</p>

<p>The man had used all his ammunition, and his six-shooter
had thus become useless. With the skill of
an Indian he wrought a bow and arrows. He made
snowshoes and continued to hunt, keeping the wolf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in meat until she grew strong and fat with the unaccustomed
luxurious life.</p>

<p>Also she became very tame. During her weakness
the man had subdued her, and through the long
nights she lay nestled within the man’s great arms and
slept.</p>

<p>When the snow became crusted, Antoine and
Susette went hunting together, she trotting at his heels
like a dog. To her he had come to be only an unusually
large wolf&mdash;a masterful male, a good fighter,
strong to kill, a taker of his own.</p>

<p>One evening in late December, when the low moon
threw a shaft of cold silver into the mouth of the
lair, Antoine lay huddled in his furs, listening to the
long, dirge-like calls of the wolves wandering inward
from the vast pitiless night. Susette also listened,
sitting upon her haunches beside the man with her
ears pricked forward. When the far away cries of
her kinspeople arose into a compelling major sound,
dying away into the merest shadow of a pitiful minor,
she switched her tail uneasily, shuffled about nervously,
sniffing and whining.</p>

<p>Then she began pacing with an eager swing up and
down the place to the opening and back to the man,
sending forth the cry of kinship whenever she
reached the moonlit entrance.</p>

<p>“Night’s cold, Susette,” said Antoine; “tain’t no
time fer huntin’. Hain’t I give you enough to eat?
Come here and snuggle up and let’s sleep.”</p>

<p>He caught the wolf and with main force held her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
down beside him. She snarled savagely and snapped
her jaws together, struggling out of his arms and
going to the opening where she cried out into the
frozen stillness. The answer of her kind floated back
in doleful chorus.</p>

<p>“Don’t go!” begged the man. “Susette, my
pretty Susette! I’ll be so lonesome.”</p>

<p>As the chorus died, the wolf gave a loud yelp and
rushed out into the night. A terrible rage seized Antoine.
He leaped from his furs and ran out after
the wolf. She fled with a rapid, swinging trot over
the scintillating snow toward the concourse of her
people. The man fled after, slipping, falling, getting
up, running, running, and ever the wolf widened the
glittering stretch of snow between them. To Antoine,
the ever-widening space of glinting coldness
vaguely symbolised the barrier that seemed growing
between him and his last companion.</p>

<p>“Susette, O, Susette!” he cried at last, breathless
and exhausted. His cry was dirge-like, even as the
wolves’; thin and sharp and ice-like&mdash;the voice of the
old world-ache.</p>

<p>She had disappeared in the dusk of a ravine. Antoine,
huddled in the snows with his face upon his
knees, sobbed in the winter stillness. At last, with
slow and faltering step, he returned to his lair; and
for the first time in months he felt the throat-pang
of the alien.</p>

<p>He threw himself down upon the floor of the cave
and cursed the world. Then he cursed Susette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s some other wolf!” he hissed. “Some other
grey dog that she’s gone to see. O, damn him! damn
his grey hide! I’ll kill her when she comes back!”</p>

<p>He took out his knife and began whetting it
viciously upon his boot.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut her into strips and eat ’em! Wasn’t I
good to her? O, I’ll cut her into strips!”</p>

<p>He whetted his knife for an hour, cursing the
while through his set teeth. At last his anger grew
into a foolish madness. He hurled himself upon the
bunch of furs beside him and imagined that they were
Susette. He set his teeth into the furs, he crushed
them with his hands, he tore at them with his nails.
Then in the impotence of his anger, he fell upon his
face and sobbed himself to sleep.</p>

<p>Strange visions passed before him. Again he
killed Lecroix, and saw the dead face grinning at the
stars. Again he sat in his mother’s lodge and wept
because he was a stranger. Again he was fleeing,
fleeing, fleeing from a leather noose that hung above
him like a black cloud, and circled and lowered and
raised and lowered until it swooped down upon him
and closed about his neck.</p>

<p>With a yell of fright he awoke from his nightmare.
His head throbbed, his mouth was parched.
At last day came in sneakingly through the opening&mdash;a
dull, melancholy light; and with it came Susette,
sniffing, with the bristles of her neck erect.</p>

<p>“Susette! Susette!” cried the man joyfully.</p>

<p>He no longer thought of killing her. He seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
her in his arms; he kissed her frost-whitened muzzle;
he caressed her; he called her a woman. She received
his caresses with disdain. Whereat the man redoubled
his acts of fondness. He fed her and petted
her as she ate; whereat the bristles on her neck fell.
She nosed him half fondly.</p>

<p>And Antoine, man-like, was glad again. He contented
himself with touching the frayed hem of the
garment of Happiness.</p>

<p>He ate none that day. He said to himself, “I
won’t hunt till it’s all gone; she can have it all.” He
was afraid to leave Susette. He was afraid to take
her with him again into the land of her own people.
Antoine was jealous.</p>

<p>All day he was kind to her with the pitiful kindness
of a doting lover for his unfaithful mistress.</p>

<p>That night she consented to lie within his arms,
and Antoine cried softly as he whispered into her
ear: “Susette, I hain’t a goin’ to be jealous no more.
You’ve been a bad girl, Susette. Don’t do it again.
I won’t be mean less’n you let <i>him</i> come skulkin’
round here, damn his grey hide! But O, Susette”&mdash;his
voice was like a spoken pang&mdash;“I wisht&mdash;I wisht
I was that other wolf!”</p>

<p>The next morning Antoine did not get up. He
felt sore and exhausted. By evening his heart was
beating like a hammer. His head ached and swam;
his burning eyes saw strange, uncertain visions.</p>

<p>“Susette,” he called, “I hain’t quite right; come
here and let me touch you again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Night was falling and Susette sat sullenly apart,
listening for the call of her people. She did not go
to him. All night the man tossed and raved. After
a lingering age of delirious wanderings, dizzy flights
from huge pitiless pursuers, he became conscious of
the daylight. He raised his head feebly and looked
about the den. Susette was gone. A fury of jealousy
again seized Antoine. She had gone to that other
wolf&mdash;he felt certain of that. He tried to arise, but
the fever had weakened him so that he lay impotently,
torn alternately with anger and longing.</p>

<p>Suddenly a frost-whitened snout was thrust in at
the opening. It was Susette. The man was too
weak to cry out his joy, but his eyes filled with a soft
light.</p>

<p>Susette entered sniffing strangely, whining and
switching her tail as she came. At her heels followed
another grey wolf&mdash;a male, larger-boned, lanker,
with a more powerful snout. He whined and moved
his tail nervously at sight of the man.</p>

<p>Antoine lay staring impotently upon the intruder.
“So that’s him,” thought the man; “I wisht I could
get up.”</p>

<p>A delirious anger shook him; he struggled to arise,
but could not. “O God,” he moaned; it was an unusual
thing for this man to say the word so; “O God,
please le’ me get up and fight!”</p>

<p>A harsh growl stopped him. The grey intruder
approached him with a rapid, sinuous movement of
the tail. His jaws grinned hideously with long sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
teeth displayed. The rage of hunger was in his eyes
fixed steadily upon the sick man.</p>

<p>Antoine stared steadily into the glaring eyes of his
wolfish rival, already crouching for the spring.</p>

<p>On a sudden, a strange exhilaration came over the
man. He seemed drinking in the essence of life from
the pitiless stare of his adversary. His great limbs,
seeming devitalised but a moment before, now tingled
to their extremities with a sudden surging of the
wine of life. His eyes, which the fever had burned
into the dulness of ashes, flamed suddenly again with
the eager lust of fight.</p>

<p>He raised himself upon his haunches, beast-like,
and with the lifting of a sneering lip that disclosed his
grinding teeth, he gave a cry that was both a snarl
and a sob. In that moment, these many centuries
of artificial life were as a vanished dream. From the
long-slumbering dust of the prehistoric cave-man
came a giant spirit to steel the sinews of its far removed
and weaker kin.</p>

<p>Antoine met the impetuous spring of the wolf with
the downward blow of a fist, and sprang whining
upon his momentarily worsted foe. Never before
had he fought in all his bitter pariah life as now he
fought for the possession of his last companion.</p>

<p>His antagonist was larger than Susette, the survivor
of many moonlit battles to the death in the
frozen, foodless wilderness of hills.</p>

<p>Antoine struggled not as a man; he was now merely
the good, glorious, fighting beast&mdash;masterful, primitive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the keeper of his own. Lacerated with the snapping
of powerful jaws, bleeding from his face and
hands, the man felt that he was winning. With a
whining cry, less than half human, he succeeded in
fixing his left hand upon the hairy throat, crushed
the wolf down upon its back, and with prodigious
strength, began pressing the fingers of his right hand
in between the protruding lower ribs. He would tear
them out! He would thrust his hand in among the
vitals of his foe!</p>

<p>All the while Susette, whining and switching her
tail, watched with glowing eyes the struggle of the
males, and waited for the proof of the master.</p>

<p>At this juncture she arose with a nervous, threatening
swaying of the head, approached the two cautiously,
then hurled herself into the encounter. She
leaped with a savage yelp upon him who had long
been her master.</p>

<p>The man’s grip relaxed. He fell back and threw
out his arms in which once more the weakness of
the fever came.</p>

<p>“Susette!” he gasped; “I was good to you;
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His voice was choked into a wheeze. Susette had
gripped him by the throat, and the two were upon
him.</p>

<p>She had gone back to the ways of her kind&mdash;and
the man was an alien.</p>

<h2 class="p4">II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LOOK IN THE FACE</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">IT was after one of the Saturday night feasts at
No-Teeth Lodge that I drew my old friend,
Half-a-Day, to one side where the shadows
were not broken by the firelight.</p>

<p>“Tell me another story, Half-a-Day,” I said.</p>

<p>He grunted and puffed at his pipe in silence.</p>

<p>“Have I not given much cow meat to the feast
and did I not throw silver on the drums?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” he assented.</p>

<p>“Then I wish to hear a story.”</p>

<p>“You are my friend,” he began with majestic deliberation,
speaking in his own tongue; “for we
have eaten meat together from the same kettle and
looked upon each other through the pipe smoke. It
will therefore make me glad to tell you a story about
buffalo meat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, about a hunt?”</p>

<p>“And a <i>me-zhinga</i> [girl]&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, a love story!”</p>

<p>“And a man whom I wished to kill.”</p>

<p>“Good! And did you kill him?”</p>

<p>“My brother is like all his white brothers, who
leap at things. Never will they wait. If I said yes
or no, then would I have no story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then give me a puff at the pipe, Half-a-Day, and
I will be patient.”</p>

<p>Half-a-Day gave me the pipe and began, with eyes
staring through the fire and far away down the long
trail that leads back to youth.</p>

<p>“Many winters and summers ago I was a young
man; now I am slow when I walk and my head looks
much to the ground. But I remember, and now again
I am young for a little while. I can smell the fires
in the evening that roared upward then, even tho’ they
are cold these many moons and their ashes scattered.
And I can see the face of Paezha [flower], the one
daughter of Douba Mona, for my eyes are young too.
And Douba Mona was a great man.</p>

<p>“Paezha was not so big as the other squaws, and
could never be so big, because she was not made for
building tepees and bringing wood and water. She
was little and thin and good to see like some of your
white sisters, and there was no face in the village of
my people like her face. Her feet touched the ground
with a light touch like a little wind from the south;
her body bent easily like a willow; I think her eyes
were like stars.”</p>

<p>I smiled here, because the simile has become so
trite among us white lovers. But Half-a-Day saw
me not; he looked down the long trail that leads back
to youth, leading through and beyond the fire.</p>

<p>“And I looked upon her face until I could see
nothing else&mdash;not the sunrise nor the sunset nor the
moon and stars. Her face became a medicine face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
me; because I was a young man and it was good to
see her. And also, I was a poor young man; my
father had few ponies, and her father had as many as
one could see with a big look.</p>

<p>“But I was strong and proud and in the long
nights I dreamed of Paezha, till one day I said: ‘I
will have her and I will fight all the braves in all the
villages before I will give her up. Then afterwards
I will get many ponies like her father.’</p>

<p>“So one evening when the meat boiled over the
fires, I went down to the big spring and hid in the
grass, for it was the habit of Paezha to bring cold
water to her father in the evenings, carrying it in a
little kettle no bigger than your head covering, for
she was not big.</p>

<p>“And I lay waiting. I could not hear the bugs
nor the running of the spring water nor the wind in
the willows, because my heart sang so loud.</p>

<p>“And I heard a step&mdash;and it was Paezha. She
leaned over the spring, and looked down; then there
were two Paezhas, so my wish for her was doubled
and had the strength of two wishes.</p>

<p>“I arose from the grass. She looked upon me
and fear came into her eyes; for there was that in
my face which wished to conquer, and I was very
strong. Like the <i>tae-chuga</i> [antelope] she leaped
and ran with wind-feet down the valley. I was without
breath when I caught her, and I lifted her with
arms too strong, for she cried.”</p>

<p>Half-a-Day reached toward me for the pipe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
puffed strongly. His eyes were masterful, with the
world-old spirit of the conquering male in them.</p>

<p>“Then as I held her, I looked upon her face and
saw what I had never seen before: a look in the face
that was sad and weak and frightened, begging for
pity. Only it was not all that; it was shining like
the sun through a cloud, and it was stronger than I,
for I became weak and could hold her no longer. A
little while she looked with wide eyes upon me; and
then I saw what makes the squaws break their backs
carrying wood and water and <i>zhinga zhingas</i>
[babies]; also what makes men fight and do great
deeds that are not selfish.</p>

<p>“Then she ran from me and I fell upon my face
and cried like a <i>zhinga zhinga</i> at the back of a squaw&mdash;I
know not why.”</p>

<p>Half-a-Day puffed hard at his pipe, then sighing
handed it to me.</p>

<p>“Have you seen that look in the face, White
Brother?” he said, staring upon me with eyes that
mastered me.</p>

<p>“I am very young,” I answered.</p>

<p>“But when you see it, it will make you old,” continued
Half-a-Day; “for when I arose and went back
to the village I was old and nothing was the same.
From that time I could look into the eyes of the
biggest brave without trembling, for I was a man and
I had seen the look.</p>

<p>“And it was in the time when the sunflowers die,
the time for the hunting of bison. So the whole tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
made ready for the hunt. One morning we rode out
of the village on the bison trail; and we were so
many that the foremost were lost in the hills when
the last left the village. And we all sang, but the
ponies neighed at the lonesome lodges, for they were
leaving home.</p>

<p>“Many days we travelled toward the evenings,
and there was song in me even when I did not sing;
for always I rode near Paezha, who rode in a blanket
swung on poles between two ponies, for she was the
daughter of a rich man. And I spoke gentle words
to her, and she smiled&mdash;because she had seen my
weakness in the valley of the big spring. Also I
picked flowers for her, and she took them.</p>

<p>“But one day Black Dog rode on the other side
of her and spoke soft words. And a strange look was
on the face of Paezha, but not the look I had seen.
So I drove away the bitterness of my heart and spoke
good words to Black Dog. But he was sullen, and
also he was better to look upon than I. I can say
this now, for I have felt the winds of many winters.</p>

<p>“Many sleeps we rode toward the places of the
evening. The moon was thin and small and bent like
a child’s bow when we started, and it hung low above
the sunset. And as we travelled it grew bigger, ever
farther toward the place of morning, until it was like
a white sun. Then at last it came forth no more, but
rested in its black tepee after its steep trail.</p>

<p>“And all the while we strained our eyes from many
lonesome hilltops, but saw no bison. Scarcer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
scarcer became the food, for the summer had been
a summer of fighting; we had conquered and feasted
much, hunted little.</p>

<p>“So it happened that we who were strong took less
meat that the weaker might live until we found the
bison. And all the time the strength of Paezha’s
face grew upon me, so that I divided my meat with
her. It made me sing to see her eat.</p>

<p>“One day she said to me: ‘Why do you sing,
Half-a-Day, when the people are sad?’ And I said:
‘I sing because I am empty.’ And Black Dog, who
rode upon the other side, he did not sing. So she said
to him: ‘Why do you not sing, Black Dog? Is it
because we do not find the bison?’ And Black Dog
said: ‘I do not sing because I am empty.’</p>

<p>“All day I was afraid that Paezha had judged
between us, seeing me so light of thought and deed.</p>

<p>“One evening we stopped for the night and there
was not enough meat left to keep us three sleeps
longer. The squaws did not sing as they pitched the
tepees. They were empty, the braves were empty,
and the <i>zhinga zhingas</i> whined like little baby wolves
at their mothers’ backs, for the milk they drank was
thin milk. No one spoke. The fires boomed up and
made the hills sound as with the bellowing of bulls,
and the sound mocked us. The dark came down; we
sat about the fires but we did not speak. We groaned,
for we were very empty, and we could not eat until
we had slept. Once every sleep we ate, and we had
eaten once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“That night the wise old men gathered together
in the tepee of the chiefs and sang medicine songs
that Wakunda [God] might hear and see our suffering;
then might he send us the bison.</p>

<p>“I heard the songs and I felt a great strength grow
up out of my emptiness. Then I said: ‘I will go
to the fathers and they will send me in search of the
bison; and I will find the bison for Paezha that she
may not starve.’ I had forgotten myself and my
people. I knew only Paezha, for that day I had
heard her moan, having nothing more to give.</p>

<p>“And I went to the big tepee. I stood amongst
the fathers and lifted a strong voice in spite of my
emptiness: ‘Give me a swift pony and a little meat
and I will find the bison!’</p>

<p>“And the old men sighed as they looked upon me.
And Douba Mona, her father, being one of the wise
men, said: ‘I see a light in his eye and hear a
strength in his voice. Give him the swift pony and
the little meat. If he finds the bison, then shall he
have Paezha, for well I see that there is something
between them. Also he shall have many ponies; I
have many.’</p>

<p>“And these words made me full as though I had
sat at a feast.</p>

<p>“So the next morning I took the swift pony and
the little meat and galloped toward the evening. The
people did not take the trail that day, for toil makes
hunger.</p>

<p>“Two sleeps I rode, singing songs and dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
dreams of Paezha. And on the evening of the third
sunlight I stopped upon a hill, and turned my pony
loose to feed. I was sick and weak because my emptiness
had come back upon me and I had not yet found
the bison. I fell upon my face and moaned, and my
emptiness sent me to sleep.</p>

<p>“When I awoke, someone sat beside me&mdash;and it
was Black Dog. He breathed soft words. ‘I have
come to watch over Half-a-Day,’ he said, ‘because I
am older and a bigger man.’</p>

<p>“I spoke not a word, but my heart was warm toward
Black Dog, for my dreams of Paezha had made
me kind.</p>

<p>“‘Well I know,’ he said, and his voice was soft as
a woman’s; ‘well I know what Half-a-Day dreams
about. And I have come to watch over him that his
dream may come true.’</p>

<p>“Then being a young man and full of kindness, I
told Black Dog of the look I had seen in the face of
Paezha. And he bit his lips and made a sound far
down in his throat that was not pleasant to hear. And
I fell to sleep wondering much.</p>

<p>“When I awoke, the ponies were gone, the meat
was gone, Black Dog was gone. I grew strong as a
bear. I shrieked into the stillness! I shook my fists
at the sun! I cursed Black Dog! I stumbled on
over the hills and valleys, shouting, singing, hurling
big words of little meaning into the yellow day.</p>

<p>“Before night came I found the body of a dead
wolf, and I fell upon it like a crow. I tore its flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with my teeth. I called it Black Dog. I ate much.
It smelled bad. I found a little stream and drank
much. It was almost lost in the mud. I slept and
dreamed of Paezha. I awoke, and it was day again.
I found the dead wolf again. I ate. Then I
was stronger and I went on into the empty yellow
prairie.</p>

<p>“Toward evening I heard a thundering, yet saw
no cloud. It was the dry time. Still it thundered,
thundered&mdash;yet no cloud. I ran to the top of a hill
and gazed.</p>

<p>“Bison! Bison! The prairie was full of bison,
and they were feeding slowly toward the camp of my
people.</p>

<p>“I turned, I ran! I did not make a sound, tho’ I
wished to cry out. I needed all my strength for running,
for I had no pony. I ran, ran, ran. I fell, I
got up, I fell. Night came; I walked. Morning
came; still I walked. Night came; I stumbled. And
in the morning I was creeping.</p>

<p>“I do not know when I reached the camp of my
people, I remember only a shouting and a sudden
moving of the tribe. And then, after many bad
dreams, I was awake again and the people were
feasting. They had found the bison.</p>

<p>“Then, when we were on the home trail, I learned
of the treachery of Black Dog. He had told my
people how he had found Half-a-Day dead upon the
prairie, but was too weak to bring him back. And
the people believed for a time. And Black Dog spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
soft words to Paezha, brave words to Douba Mona,
until I was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>“But now I was a great man among my people,
and Black Dog could not raise his head, for he had
seen hate in the people’s eyes.</p>

<p>“And in the time of the first frosts we reached our
village and Paezha became my squaw. Also I got
the ponies.”</p>

<p>Here Half-a-Day paused to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>“It is a good story, Half-a-Day,” I said. Half-a-Day
lit his pipe, stared long into the glow of the
embers, for the fires had fallen, and sighed.</p>

<p>“I have not spoken yet,” he said; “for one day in
the time of the first snow, Paezha lay dead in my
lodge, and my breast ached. Black Dog had killed
her at the big spring. At the same place where I had
first seen the look, there he killed her.</p>

<p>“I remember that I sat beside her two sleeps and
cried like a <i>zhinga zhinga</i>. And my friends came to
me, whispering bitter words into my ears. ‘Kill
Black Dog,’ they said. And I said: ‘Bring him here
to me, and I will kill him; my legs will not carry me.’</p>

<p>“But the fathers of the council would not have it
so. And when they had buried her on the hill above
the village, I awoke as from a long sleep, a very long
sleep, and I was full of hate. They kept me in my
lodge. They would not let me kill. I wished to kill!
I wished to tear him as I tore the stinking wolf with
my teeth! <i>I wished to kill!</i>”</p>

<p>Half-a-Day had arisen to his feet, his fists clenched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
his eyes shining with a cold light. He made a tragic
figure in the dull, blue glow of the embers.</p>

<p>“Come, Half-a-Day,” I said, “it is long passed,
and now it is only a story.”</p>

<p>“It is more than a story!” he said. “I lived it.
I wished to kill!”</p>

<p>He sat down again, and a softer light came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“And the time came,” he went on with a weary
voice, “when Black Dog should be cast forth from
the tribe, according to the old custom. I said, ‘I will
follow Black Dog, and I will see him die.’ And he
was cast forth. I followed, and it was very cold.
The snow whined under my feet, and I followed in
the night.</p>

<p>“But Black Dog did not know I followed. I was
ever near him like a shadow. I did not sleep; I
watched Black Dog. I meant to see him die.</p>

<p>“In his first sleep I crept upon him. I stole his
meat; I stole his weapons. Now he would die, and
I would be there to see. I would laugh, I would sing
while he died.</p>

<p>“In the cold, pale morning I lay huddled in a
clump of sage and I saw him get up, look for his meat
and weapons, then stagger away into the lonesome
places of the snow. And I sang a low song to myself.
The time would come when I would see Black Dog
die. I did not feel the cold; I did not grow weary;
I was never hungry. And in the evenings I was ever
near enough to hear him groan as he wrapped himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in his blankets. Often I crept up to him and looked
upon his face in the light of the stars, and I saw my
time coming, for his face was thinner and not so good
to look upon as in the time when the sunflowers died.</p>

<p>“I could have killed him, but then he could not
have heard me sing, he could not have heard me
laugh. So I waited and followed and watched. I ate
my meat raw that Black Dog might not see my fire.
Also I watched to see that he found nothing to eat;
and he found nothing.</p>

<p>“One day I lay upon the summit of a hill and saw
him totter in the valley. Then I could be quiet no
longer. I raised my voice and shouted: ‘Fall, Black
Dog! Even so Half-a-Day fell when Black Dog
stole his meat and his pony!’</p>

<p>“And I saw him get up and stare about, for I was
hidden. Then his voice came up to me over the snow;
it was a thin voice: ‘I know you, Half-a-Day! Come
and kill me!’</p>

<p>“‘Half-a-Day never killed a sick man nor a
squaw,’ I shouted, and then I laughed&mdash;a cold, bitter
laugh. Then Black Dog shook his fists at the four
corners of the sky and stumbled off into the hills, and
I followed. Now my time was very near, for Black
Dog felt my nearness and he knew that he would die
and I would see him.</p>

<p>“And one evening my time came. Black Dog was
in the valley by a frozen stream, and he fell upon his
face, sending forth a thin cry as he fell&mdash;thin and ice-like.
He did not get up. He lay very still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ran down to where he lay&mdash;and I laughed,
laughed, laughed. I heard him groan. I rolled him
over on his back and looked upon his face.</p>

<p>“I wish I had not looked upon his face!</p>

<p>“He opened his eyes and they were very dim and
sunken. His face was sharp. I sat down beside him.
I said, ‘Now die, and I will sing about it.’</p>

<p>“Then his face changed. It became a squaw’s
face&mdash;<i>and it had the look</i>!&mdash;a look that was sad and
weak and frightened and begging for pity. And it
seemed to me that it was not the face of Black Dog
any more. <i>It had the look!</i> I had seen it in the face
of Paezha by the spring!</p>

<p>“Now since I have many winters behind me, I
wonder if it was not a coward’s face; but then it was
not so. I grew soft. There was a great springtime
in my breast. The ice was breaking up. I wrapped
my blankets about him. I gave him meat. He stared
at me and ate like a wolf. I spoke soft words. I
made a fire from the brush that was on the frozen
stream. I warmed him and he grew stronger. All
night I watched him and in the morning I said:
‘Take my bow and arrows, Black Dog; I wish to die.
Go on and live.’ For I had lost the wish to kill; I
only wished to die. And he said no word; but his
eyes were changed.</p>

<p>“I staggered away on the back trail. I had no
meat, I had no blankets, I had no weapons. I meant
to die.</p>

<p>“But I did not die. When I lay down at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
worn-out and half frozen, someone wrapped blankets
about me and built a fire by me. In the mornings I
found food beside me. And so it was for many
sleeps until at last I came to the village of my people,
broken, caring for nothing. And I was thin, my
face was sharp, my eyes were sunken, my step was
slow.</p>

<p>“And the people looked upon me with wonder,
saying: ‘Half-a-Day has come back from killing
Black Dog.’</p>

<p>“But the truth was different.”</p>

<p class="p2">When Half-a-Day had finished, he stared long into
the fire without speaking.</p>

<p>“Do you think Black Dog was all a coward?” I
asked at length. “Perhaps he only loved too much.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Half-a-Day; “I only know
sometimes I wish I had not looked upon his face.”</p>

<p>Tum-um-um, tum-um-um! So sang the drums&mdash;great,
glad buckskin drums, exultant beneath the
staccato blows of the old men’s drumsticks. Tum-um-um,
tum-um-um! Now the women, dressed in their
gayest garments of dyed buckskin, radiant in beads,
with the spirit of song upon their painted faces, came
forth in a long file from a lodge and approached the
centre of the open space about which were grouped
the mud lodges of the village.</p>

<p>There, in the centre, sat the old men. The drums
were singing a glad song, in sullen tones, in this hour
of victory, for a runner, breathless with his speed,
had brought the good news when the sun was halfway
down the sky, and now the slowly setting sun
was blazing on the evening hills.</p>

<p>Soon the whole victorious band, fresh from their
fight with the Sioux, would come over the hills like
an eager, dusty wind, clamorous with glad tongues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and thunderous with the driven hoofs of captured
ponies.</p>

<p>So the drums sang and the women came forth and
circled about them, peering beneath hands raised
browward, into the deepening shadows of the valley
down which the band would sweep.</p>

<p>They swelled the song of victory, the song of welcome
to the victors, and the look of welcome was
already upon their faces as they searched the deepening
shadows.</p>

<p>There came a rumble over the hills as of a hidden
storm in time of drouth, thundering mockingly in the
rainless air. The drummers lifted their sticks with
trembling hands and listened&mdash;with one accord they
all listened for the shouts and the hoof beats.</p>

<p>Now the faint treble of distant shouting pierced
the growing rumble of the thunder. It was the
braves! They were returning with much glory and
many ponies. The drumsticks fell snarlingly upon
the taut buckskin, but the sound seemed only a whisper,
for the entire village was shouting with a tumult
that made the grazing ponies snort upon the hillsides
and gallop away with ears pricked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“They come! They come!”</p>

<p>The villagers thronged upon that side of the village
that looked toward the hills from whence the
thunder deepened. A dust cloud gathered behind the
hills. It grew until it caught the horizontal sunlight
and seemed a scintillating tower of victory. Suddenly
the hill above the valley was thronged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mounted braves, waving their weapons above their
heads and shouting, and a sunlit cloud of glory seemed
about them.</p>

<p>The band swept down the hillside and down the
valley, and the dust cloud thickened under the impetuous
hoofs that beat the parched and yellow prairie.
When they drew near the opening in the circle
of lodges, the foremost hurled his panting pony back
upon its haunches and the others reared and halted
behind, champing at the restraining thongs.</p>

<p>“A-ho!” shouted the foremost, holding his
weapons above his head. “We come from the
Sioux! We have many ponies and also scalp-locks!
Sing! For we have fought a good fight and we are
not ashamed!”</p>

<p>A great shout went up from the village, and the
drums snarled. Slowly, majestically, the circle of
women began moving about the drums, keeping time
to the rhythmic beats with a sideward shuffling of
their feet in the dust. In a monotonous minor key
the singing of the women began&mdash;at first like the
crooning of an Indian mother to a restless child when
the camp fires burn blue, and all the braves are snoring
in the dark.</p>

<p>Then it rose into the mournful wail of a wife
looking upon a dead face&mdash;a wordless, eloquent song.
Then, with a burst, it rose into a treble cry, and
words became dimly recognisable amid the ecstasy.</p>

<p>“We come, we come, and we are not ashamed!”
sang the women to the snarling of the drums. “Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the fires roar and the bison meat be cooked, for we
have fought, and now we wish to eat!</p>

<p>“Let the women dance and sing that we may be
glad after our fighting! A-ho! A-ho! We travelled
far&mdash;one sleep, two sleeps, three sleeps, but we slumbered
not! We came upon our enemies. They were
hidden in the grass like badgers. They were dressed
in yellow grass that they might hide. We saw them
and we shouted with joy, for we were not afraid! The
enemy trembled like wolves who have come to the
end of the ravine and the hunters follow behind!”</p>

<p>As the women sang, shuffling about the circle, the
braves rode in single file into the enclosure of the
village and formed a circle about the dance.</p>

<p>“I saw a big man among my enemies,” sang the
women, for so their song ran. “He was strong as
a bear and terrible as an elk. His head was proud
with eagle feathers, for many men had he killed. I
did not tremble when he rushed at me; I raised my
club and struck him, and he fell with his eagle
feathers. He whimpered like an old woman when
she becomes a child again. He said, ‘I have many
ponies for you, and my children will cry if I do not
go back. Spare me!’ But behold! I have his scalp
lock!”</p>

<p>“His scalp lock! His scalp lock!” shouted the
braves, as the words of the song were drowned again
in the minor drone that followed the snarl of the
drums. And they waved scalp locks above their heads&mdash;the
locks of the fallen Sioux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the droning the song of the women grew
again. It became more ecstatic, running the gamut
of human passion&mdash;from the shrill shriek of defiance
to the mournful wail for those who had fallen in the
battle. And then the shuffling stopped; the song died
away into a drone and ceased, like the song of a locust
at the end of a sultry evening. The drums snarled
no more, a great silence fell, the sun had sunk beneath
the hills.</p>

<p>Then, in the silence and the shadows of the evening,
one came forth from among the circle of braves,
and, with a slow, majestic bending of the knees,
danced in a circle about the women and the drums,
that began again as an accompaniment to the song
that he would sing.</p>

<p>Round and round the circle he danced, improvising
a song to the rhythm of the drums, in which he sang
his prowess, and the whole village shouted when he
reached the end of his song, for he told of a good
fight and a strong arm, and he had been great in
battle.</p>

<p>Then, amid the shouting, another came forth to
dance and sing, for he too had done great things.
It was White Cloud, and he was great among his
people. Round and round the circle he danced to the
tune of the drums, dodging imaginary arrows, leaping
upon imaginary foes, striking huge blows at the
heads of warriors hidden in the shadow.</p>

<p>“See!” he shouted in his song, and his voice was
loud and masterful, for a murmur of praise had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
passed among the people. “See! White Cloud
brings the scalp lock of a chief. He took it alone
with his strong hand. The scalp lock of a big Sioux
chief! Who has done a greater deed than White
Cloud? Then let the old men place the eagle feather
in his hair that he may be known among his
people.”</p>

<p>Once again the dancing stopped and the drums
ceased their droning. White Cloud approached the
old men, who slowly placed the eagle feather in his
hair.</p>

<p>But one among the assembled braves did not give
his voice to the shout that ensued.</p>

<p>His gaze narrowed with hatred as he looked upon
White Cloud, and his body trembled as a strong tree
that stands alone in the path of a tempest.</p>

<p>Then as White Cloud strode proudly to the inner
rim of the circle of braves, with the tall eagle feather
in his hair, another came forth bearing with him
his bow and his arrows. It was he who had found no
voice in which to celebrate White Cloud’s valour.</p>

<p>He was tall and sinewy, and he had the clear-cut,
cruel face of a hawk, now dark with a darkness
deeper than the shadow of the evening. It was Little
Weasel.</p>

<p>Erect, quivering like a strong bow in the clutch of
a mighty warrior, he walked into the open space, and
the drums once more began their wailing. But Little
Weasel raised one trembling hand and commanded
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fathers,” he said, and his voice was low, vibrant
with the growl of a wounded beast in it, “Little
Weasel needs no drums to help him fill the stillness.”</p>

<p>The people bent forward, hushed, because there
was something deeper than shadow in the face of
Little Weasel as he turned his hawk’s gaze upon the
bowed head of White Cloud.</p>

<p>“Little Weasel has words to utter, but they are
not song words nor dance words. Let the women
and cowards sing and dance!”</p>

<p>Still the head of White Cloud was bowed, and
Little Weasel laughed a strange laugh.</p>

<p>“Who took the scalplock of the big Sioux chief?”
shouted Little Weasel. “I, Little Weasel, took it!
One sleep, two sleeps, I kept it close beside me; for
I am a young man and I wanted to hear the shouts of
my people. But in the third sleep a great heaviness
came upon me, and when I awoke my Sioux scalp lock
had been stolen from me. Now I know the badger
who crept upon me in my heaviness and stole my
honour from me. Look! You have placed the eagle
feather in his hair!”</p>

<p>In the hush that filled that shadowed place naught
but the heavy breathing of the people was heard.
Little Weasel fitted a feathered arrow to his bow.</p>

<p>“See!” he cried. “I do not cry about my stolen
feather. I give another!”</p>

<p>The bow-thong twanged, the arrow sang, and
lodged deep in White Cloud’s breast.</p>

<p>“Let White Cloud wear that feather in his breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
so that the black spirits will know him! For look!
Already he is among them!”</p>

<p>White Cloud had fallen upon his face. Little
Weasel dropped his bow upon the ground, and, raising
his hands above his head, he shouted into
the stillness: “Fathers, I have given feather for
feather!”</p>

<p>Then a great cry broke from the assembled braves
and the women shrieked. But Little Weasel shouldered
his way through the throng and went to his
lodge, laughing bitterly.</p>

<p>That evening the fires of the feast did not roar
upward into the night. There was no song; there
was no babble of glad voices; there was no bubbling
of kettle nor scent of meat.</p>

<p>For a member of the tribe had been murdered by
a tribesman, and the murderer, according to an ancient
custom, would be driven forth that night from
the circle of the lodges into the prairie. And the
people sat speechless at the dark doors of their lodges
awaiting the signal.</p>

<p>After a long and wordless waiting in the dark, the
people saw the door-flap of the big council lodge
swing open, and they held their breaths, for the time
of the casting forth had come.</p>

<p>Through the hush of the starlit night came Little
Weasel, pacing slowly about the circle of the village,
and the fathers of the council, slow with age, followed
behind.</p>

<p>Three times the outcast made the rounds, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he began the fourth and last circle (for four is a
medicine number), the old men who followed raised
their faces to the starlit sky and breathed these
words into the quiet:</p>

<p>“Let the people look upon Little Weasel, our
brother, for he has killed a brother and must suffer.
Four times shall the bears bring forth their cubs;
four times shall the lone goose fly; four times shall
the frogs sing in the valleys; four times shall the
sunflowers grow; and he must wander, wander. Then
shall Little Weasel return and his deed shall be forgotten.
<i>Wah-hoo-ha-a-a-a!</i>”</p>

<p>Then when Little Weasel came the fourth time to
the opening in the circle of lodges, looking toward
the place of sunrise, he saw one standing in the dark
who held a pony by a thong. And Little Weasel
leaped upon the pony, laughed a loud, unpleasant
laugh, and urged it southward into the night.</p>

<p>Throughout the night the people in the village
heard strange sounds. For at times somewhere in
the darkness of the hills, something laughed a loud,
unmirthful laugh.</p>

<p>“Do you hear it?” the people whispered. “It
is a wolf. For sometimes in the lonesome nights they
laugh so.” But the people muffled their ears in their
blankets, for it is not good to hear a wolf laugh
almost like a man.</p>

<p>All night long Little Weasel wandered upon the
hills, holding his grazing pony and looking down
upon the starlit village of his people. He laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
loudly at times, for he was not one of those who
sadden with trouble.</p>

<p>“How can I get revenge upon my people?” he
asked himself. And as yet he could not answer.</p>

<p>The pale dawn found him sitting upon the hills.
Then he arose and mounted his pony and the three
went southward&mdash;the pony, the man, and the question.</p>

<p>A light wind blew upon his back.</p>

<p>“How can I get revenge upon my people?” he
sang aloud in endless variation until his question wove
itself into a song&mdash;a battle song, for Little Weasel
had not eaten, and hunger feeds anger. But the
light wind sighing at his back made no answer.</p>

<p>“I will go to the country of the Pawnees and make
them angry with my people,” he said to himself, and
this seemed the answer to his question until the sun
had reached its highest in the sky and the wind had
fallen and the yellow prairie had become parched and
bare.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he stopped in the glare of the sun
and held one wet finger above his head that he might
learn the source of the wind.</p>

<p>There was a faint breath from the south. As he
stood it increased, coming in little puffs, hot and fitful
and dry. Suddenly it came with a great puff and
boomed in the arid gulches.</p>

<p>Little Weasel shouted with joy.</p>

<p>He had heard his answer in the booming of the
sudden wind. He dismounted, and, with a flint and
some dry grass, lit a little fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The great wind fed it and it grew. Then Little
Weasel collected a bunch of grass, lit it and rapidly
set fire to the dry prairie.</p>

<p>Long, yellow flames leaped up from the sun-cured
buffalo-grass, howled in the wind that grew stronger
and stronger, and raced northward toward the valley
where the circled lodges of the Omahas lay.</p>

<p>“Now I will go back,” said Little Weasel, “and
the fire shall go with me.” He kicked his pony in
the ribs and pointed its head northward. The wave
of flame preceded him, skimming the surface of the
grass with great leaps, gaining strength and fleetness
as the dry wind lashed it from behind.</p>

<p>“<i>Aha-ha-he-ha-ha-ha-ha!</i>” sang Little Weasel,
and the pony, straining its wiry limbs to keep pace
with the yellow giant that ran before, wheezed and
coughed an accompaniment to the song, for the ashes
were in his nostrils.</p>

<p>Over hills, through valleys, across gulches the
pony ran, with the wall of flame ever a strong
man’s bow-shot ahead of him.</p>

<p>Now the Omahas, who had been deprived of their
feast of victory the evening before, had made the
feast fires roar upward throughout the village that
day and much meat had been eaten.</p>

<p>Weary with much dancing and singing and heavy
with meat, the evening twilight found them sleeping
heavily. And the night deepened and still they slept.</p>

<p>But there was one upon whom the feast had laid
but a light hand, and who awoke suddenly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
night with a smell in his nostrils, a roaring in his
ears, and a great light in his eyes. He marvelled,
for the feast fires were dead in their ashes.</p>

<p>He arose, and when he reached the door of his
lodge he gave a cry that woke the sleeping village
and brought the people clamouring into the open air.</p>

<p>Half the earth and half the sky were aflame. The
stars had fled before the great burning. Booming
in the strong wind, a wave of flame was coming over
the hills and reaching long, spiteful arms toward the
village in the valley.</p>

<p>Spellbound, the people gazed. Then of a sudden a
cry ran among them, for they had seen, through a
momentary rift in the flame and smoke, high upon
the eminence of a peaked, fire-blackened hill, a man
standing upon a pony’s back, with his arms above his
head. He looked prodigiously big and seemed to
ride upon a flood of fire.</p>

<p>Then the flames closed in, the smoke hid the
peaked hill, and frantically the people fled from
their village to a nearby creek, where they huddled
in the stream, and where the loud flame passed over
them, booming on into the north.</p>

<p>When the gray of morning fell upon the blackened
prairie, the people returned to their village.
But at the opening in the circle of lodges stood a
mounted man. Both he and his pony were blackened
as with fire. It was Little Weasel.</p>

<p>As his people drew near he raised a wheezing
voice and said: “Behold Little Weasel, whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fire-spirits love! All day I rode across the hills,
thinking of my people’s unkindness. In the evening
a great fire grew up about me. It was not a
common fire; it was a medicine fire. It grew up
about me and my pony, and lifted us like the waters
of a flood. And I was frightened till I heard a voice
that thundered, and it said: ‘Little Weasel has
been punished by a foolish people. The spirits of
fire will take him back and his people will take
him in again.’ And lo! here I am, Little Weasel.
I want my eagle feather.”</p>

<p>And the people, believing many strange things,
took him in with a great feasting.</p>

<p>And from that day they called him by another
name&mdash;Paeda-Nu, the Fire-Man.</p>

<p>And he was great among his people.</p>

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SCARS</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">MY friend, the old frontiersman, poked an
extra supply of cobs into the stove, meditatively
watched the sudden flame lick
about the husks, then began this monologue after
his usual manner:</p>

<p class="p2">Yes, I’ve got a nice place here&mdash;nice ranch.
Didn’t work for it either&mdash;lied for it!</p>

<p>Now, I’m not given much to that sort of thing,
as you will grant; but when I see a place where a
good manly twisting of the truth can sweeten matters
up a bit, I’m not so scrupulous.</p>

<p>Back in the late fifties I was living in St. Louis,
pretty nigh broke, for all I’d lived a hard, industrious
life up and down the river. One day I got a note
bearing the postmark of some California mining
town, and it informed me that I had a considerable
credit with a certain St. Louis bank. I never heard
directly where the money came from, but I thought
I knew. I bought this place with some of that
money, you see. And there’s a little story attached
to this.</p>

<p>For a number of years I was employed by the
American Fur Company as expressman. Every winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
I made the trip from St. Louis to Fort Pierre,
a distance of about a thousand miles. Carried messages
from headquarters to the posts and from the
posts back to headquarters. From St. Louis to
Pierre the trip was made on horseback, and from
there up, other expressmen carried the mail on dog
sleds.</p>

<p>Great days, those! Sometimes when I get to
thinking over old times, I wonder if the railroads
haven’t taken some of the iron out of the blood of
men.</p>

<p>In the winter of ’50&mdash;that was the year the gold
fever was raging, you know&mdash;I got to Pierre about
the middle of February. When I had delivered the
mail and was making ready to start south again with
the returns, old Choteau, the factor of the post,
called me into the hut he called his office, and made
an unusual request of me. “We’ve got a half-breed
here,” said he, “who’s got to be elevated. Understand?
Killed a man in the most atrocious manner.
He’s due at a necktie party down at St. Louis about
next spring, and I’d rather not keep him at the post;
can you take him down?”</p>

<p>I was somewhat younger in those days, and ready
for most anything new. Also, I had found the trail
a little lonesome at times. Riding a preoccupied
broncho through hundreds of miles of white silence,
hearing the coyotes yelp, dodging Indians, and bucking
blizzards weren’t  ever calculated to be social
functions, you know. So I was glad to have company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
on the trail, even if it had to be the company
of a criminal. Anyway, I had been so taught in the
great rough school of primitive men, that I had not
that loathing for a killer of his kind that is felt
by this generation.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said I to the factor. “Put him on
a mule, and I’ll see him into the government corral
at St. Louis.” So it was arranged that I should take
the man to the authorities.</p>

<p>I did not hear his name spoken and I didn’t take
the trouble to ask. It seemed to me that a man
who was being shipped out with a tag on him reading
“Nowhere,” had little use for a name. No one
was apt to dispute his identity.</p>

<p>Well, they put him on a mule, handcuffed, with a
chain to his ankles passed around the belly of the
mule. He was, of course, unarmed, and I drove him
on ahead of me to break trail. He was a powerfully
built fellow, neither tall nor short, and close-knit.
He had a face that was not so bad, showing the
French and Indian strains in him plainly. When
we had been riding along silently for several hours,
I called to him to stop and rode up beside him.</p>

<p>I looked into his eyes, and that look satisfied me
that I was safe in doing what I had thought of.
His eyes were large and black and quiet.</p>

<p>“I am going to take the cussed irons off your legs
and arms,” I said; “you can’t keep warm this way.”
He watched me taking them off and said nothing.
I threw the irons away. “Go on,” I said. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he went, giving me a look that thanked me more
than words could have done.</p>

<p>He had the eyes of a brave man. I was never
much afraid of a brave man; it’s the cowards you
have to watch, you know.</p>

<p>All day we rode, saying nothing. In the evening
we made a shelter with our blankets in the bend of
a creek where the plum bushes were thick. The
man was a good hand at the business, and seemed
anxious to please me.</p>

<p>We cooked and ate supper, then rolled up in our
blankets. I put my two six-shooters under my head
for fear that I might have somehow misread the
man’s eyes.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning, he had breakfast
cooked and the nags saddled. When we were eating
I said: “Why didn’t you take my horse and run
away? I could never have caught you with the
mule.”</p>

<p>He searched me for a moment with his eyes.</p>

<p>“Because I’m not a coward,” he said.</p>

<p>And all day we rode again in silence, until, toward
evening, he set up a wild sort of a song&mdash;a <i>chanson</i>
of his fathers, I suppose&mdash;in a voice that was strong
but sweet.</p>

<p>“You sing!” said I.</p>

<p>Breaking off his song and turning about on his
mule, he said quietly, as though he were discussing
the best way to make biscuits when you haven’t any
soda: “Did you ever see a dead liar?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said I; “but none in particular.”</p>

<p>“And that is why you never sing.”</p>

<p>That was the last word that day. Up to this
time the weather had been rather too warm for
winter&mdash;an ominous sort of a warm, you know. A
mist hung over the country, drifting with a light
wind from the southeast. During the night the wind
whipped into the northwest, and in the morning we
had a genuine frank old blizzard howling around
us; one of those fierce old boys that nobody cares
to face. We had camped in a wooded nook on the
south side of the river bluffs and were pretty well
protected, so I decided to lay up there until things
brightened up a bit.</p>

<p>The man, for I had not yet learned his name,
which was not necessary, as the mail I carried attended
to that, volunteered to gather wood; and so
I lay in the tent near the fire that roared in front,
smoking my pipe and swapping cusses with myself
on account of the delay.</p>

<p>After a while the man came in with a big arm load
of wood, whistling merrily. “Well, you beat ’em
all,” I said. “I say a man who can whistle like
that on his last trip is a game one. What’s your
name and who are you? Here, want to smoke?”</p>

<p>I gave him my pipe. He took it and blew rings
meditatively for a while. “Well,” said he, “the
name doesn’t matter much, and I’m the fellow who’s
elected to be elevated!”</p>

<p>We both laughed strangely, and I began to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
my stock of yarns, truthful and otherwise, to relieve
the tedium of the day. I had told a number of stories
when the man seemed to brighten up all at once.
His eyes became on a sudden unusually brilliant.</p>

<p>“I know a story that’s a fact,” said he. “It’s
about a friend of mine&mdash;one of the best friends I
ever had, I reckon. At least he never went back on
me. Shall I tell it?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said I.</p>

<p>And this is the story he told me:</p>

<p>“My friend’s name is Narcisse. I knew him when
he was just a little shaver. I knew his mother and
his father. In fact I was, at one time, just like one
of the family.</p>

<p>“Narcisse was a wild sort of a boy always, though
I do think his heart was in the right place, as they
say. Never betrayed a friend, never stole, and never
knuckled to an enemy. But he was a wild boy and
didn’t stay at home much after he was in his first
’teens. Knocked about the world considerable, Narcisse
did, and wound up out here in this God-forsaken
end of creation. Worked on a cordelle
gang, handled mackinaws, hammered pack mules,
fought Indians, starved and feasted, froze and
toasted, like all the others who come out here. Entered
the fur trade as <i>engagé</i> of the Company, and
was sent to a post up river.</p>

<p>“Now if there was a weak spot in Narcisse, it
was his leaning toward womenfolks. None of your
fooling, though! Narcisse loved just like he’d fight&mdash;pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
serious, you know. When he said a thing,
Narcisse he meant that; and when he wanted to do
something real bad, he did that&mdash;O, spite of hell he
did that! You know the breed? Well, that was
Narcisse.</p>

<p>“There was an old French trader living at a post
further up&mdash;old man Desjardins. He had a daughter&mdash;Paulette&mdash;by
an Indian woman who died when
the girl was just a baby, and the old man raised her
somehow&mdash;God knows how&mdash;till she grew to be
about the prettiest girl you’d see anywhere in a year’s
tramp, being a good walker. Old man doted on the
girl, and until she was full-grown there wasn’t anybody
could come nigh enough to her to make a sweet
grin effective. But once Narcisse and his friend,
Jacques Baptiste, got snowed in there on one of their
trips.</p>

<p>“Now them two, Jacques and Narcisse, was
about the best friends you ever saw, I reckon. They
never had any secrets from one another; and many’s
the time they had split the last bit of grub on long
winter trails, and made a feast of that little; because
there isn’t any feast better than a little grub split
between friends, is there?</p>

<p>“Now Paulette was a slender little creature with
black eyes and lots of black hair. Lots of hair!
That makes a woman fetching, don’t you think so?
Well, Narcisse and Jacques sang old French songs
during the blizzard, and kind of got into the old
man’s heart like. Nothing like old-time songs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fetch a man when he’s got to that place where there
isn’t any way to look but back. So the old man made
’em welcome and said for ’em to come back when
they could.</p>

<p>“On the trip from old man Desjardins’ place to
Pierre, them two friends talked pretty frank, like
they always did. Both of ’em was in love, and
neither of ’em was ashamed of it. Told each
other so.</p>

<p>“When they camped the first night they talked it
all over and Narcisse said: ‘Jacques, we’ve always
split even, but here’s where we can’t. It’s for one
of us all right, but one of us has to go without.
How about this?’</p>

<p>“And Jacques puffed at his pipe a long time, and
after a while he said: ‘Let’s agree that we’ll always
go up there together, and let her take her pick.’ And
Narcisse agreed; so that’s the way they fixed it.</p>

<p>“Managed to drop in pretty often after that.
But there wasn’t any way of telling which was it.
One visit she’d smile more at Jacques than at Narcisse,
and they’d think it was settled; and then next
time it was t’other way.</p>

<p>“It was a game, and both of ’em played it like
a game. They were too good friends to slip a bower
or ace up their sleeves. They let Paulette deal the
hands and they played ’em the best they could, same
as honest poker, you know. And all the time old
man Desjardins looked on like the man that runs the
game, a-raking in the ante, which was the singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and the laughing they did and the things they
brought up with ’em, for they never came empty-handed.</p>

<p>“Well, the next fall came; the game was still on
and neither of ’em had stole a hand nor a chip that
wasn’t his. And along about the first of September
the factor of Pierre sent the two friends on a trip
to Benton. They went up on the last boat and were
to drop down again in a maciknaw before the winter
set in, after doing a little business for the Company.</p>

<p>“On the trip up Narcisse and Jacques had a quiet
little game, which was poker. They didn’t play for
money&mdash;played for Paulette. Sort of made a jackpot
out of the girl, and it took Jacks or better to
open. One deal and a draw and the high hand could
go to see the old man by himself and close the game
that had hung on so long.</p>

<p>“Narcisse insisted on having Jacques deal.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Jacques, after the draw, ‘the jackpot’s
mine!’</p>

<p>“Narcisse throws down three aces. Jacques gasps
a little gasp and throws his cards face up on the
table, turns white and walks away. He had two
pairs&mdash;kings and queens!</p>

<p>“There wasn’t anything more said about it; but
Jacques wasn’t the same man at all. Acted like he
was thinking, thinking all the time. Face got that
peaked look that comes of too much thinking; eyes
always looking a long ways off.</p>

<p>“How do I know this? W’y, Narcisse told me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurt Narcisse like everything to see this; but
hadn’t he won fair? Friends can split even on grub
and follow the same trail for years, but there comes
a time when they must smoke their last pipe together
at the forks. But it’s all part of the game and a
man oughtn’t to grumble if he don’t get a pat hand,
as long as the deal’s fair.</p>

<p>“Narcisse and Jacques got to Benton, and when
they got ready to start back, the river had frozen
up, because the winter came down early that year.
So they had another winter trail to follow together
before they reached the forks. The factor at Benton
gave ’em a couple of good dogs to carry their bedding
and they started out afoot.</p>

<p>“Jacques didn’t have much to say. With that
peaked, set look on his face he went a-trudging on
in the snow from sunup to sundown. Narcisse
couldn’t help feeling a little happy, because Paulette
was the prettiest girl that ever haunted these parts
since the river was dug. It wasn’t any more than
human, and he’d won fair.</p>

<p>“Well, they passed Union and they passed Les
Mandanes and they passed Roubideaux’, and then
there was a long stretch of lonesome country ahead
of ’em till they got to Brown’s Landing, about two
hundred miles above Pierre.</p>

<p>“One day it came on to blow and snow, and they
made a camp in the bluff just like we did here.
That’s what reminded me of the story. Jacques
made camp while Narcisse was chopping wood. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cut down a dead cottonwood and when it came down,
he tripped up in the deep snow and the tree fell on
him. Broke his leg above the ankle. Well, there he
was a couple hundred miles toward Nowhere in
November with one leg.</p>

<p>“Pretty hard on Narcisse, wasn’t it? But Jacques
all at once began to be his old self again. Set the
leg as good as he could and tied it up so it would
stay in place, and joked and was kind to Narcisse.</p>

<p>“‘Seems like old times, pard,’ said Narcisse to
Jacques. ‘Danged if I wouldn’t be glad it happened
if we wasn’t so far from somewheres; because
we mustn’t let the trail fork, old pard. I knew you’d
be the same again when I was hard run.’</p>

<p>“And Jacques smiled and said there never was
any hard feeling, he guessed. But the peaked look
didn’t go away, nor the far-away look in the eyes.</p>

<p>“When the weather cleared up, Jacques said he’d
leave a plenty of wood and grub for Narcisse and
he’d make a run for Brown’s Landing and come back
with dogs and a sled. And that made Narcisse’s
heart warm toward Jacques, because it was just like
he was before the girl came between ’em.</p>

<p>“And Jacques left before sunup one morning, and
when it came day Narcisse went to fix him some
breakfast, and there was only enough grub left for
five or six days. That scared him, because it was a
long trip to Brown’s and back, and he couldn’t walk.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t cuss Jacques. He just said to himself:
‘He didn’t go to take so much, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
dark when he left.’ And then he just took the hand
that was dealt him and began playing against a run
of hard luck. The grub lasted only about a week,
and close picking at that. Jacques had plenty of
wood chopped up, and Narcisse sat all day by the
fire with his leg aching and his stomach a-gnawing,
a-looking down the white waste towards Brown’s.
And night ’d come and no dog sled. Then day ’d
come and he’d begin looking, looking. And when
the grub was all gone, he soaked up all the leather
there was about him and sucked that. And then he’d
begin looking, looking, looking into the white waste,
till he got so’s he could see dozens of dog sleds coming
and vanishing, coming and vanishing.</p>

<p>“But he didn’t cuss Jacques. He said: ‘The
poor devil’s been killed like as not; he wouldn’t go
back on his pard.’ And one day he felt he was getting
too weak to watch much more, and so he set a
pole in the snow with a strip of blanket tied to it;
and that tuckered him out so’s he couldn’t hardly
crawl back to shelter. And with the last strength he
had, he dragged the wood that was left up close to
him where he could reach it, because he knew that
in another day he couldn’t get up.</p>

<p>“And then he began forgetting everything ’most,
and having bad dreams that scared him, all the time
a-worrying about the fire like as if he was half
asleep, and hearing dogs barking, and trying to
get up.</p>

<p>“And then at last he didn’t know anything, till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was on a dog sled with the feel of hot soup in his
belly. And when he came to, he said: ‘I knowed
you’d come, Jacques; it was hard sledding without
the grub, though.’</p>

<p>“And then he found out it wasn’t Jacques at all;
only some Jesuit missionaries travelling from the
North. They’d seen his signal of distress a-flying,
and had come and got him.</p>

<p>“And still Narcisse didn’t cuss Jacques. He said:
‘Poor devil’s got killed or something.’</p>

<p>“And by and by the Jesuits got him to Brown’s
Landing, and he laid up there till the last of December,
getting so he could walk. There wasn’t anybody
at Brown’s who had seen Jacques; and Narcisse’s
heart ached; he thought sure Jacques was dead.</p>

<p>“And when Narcisse got well, he borrowed a horse
from the factor at Brown’s and went south to Pierre.
It was night when he got to the post. He rode up
to the cabin where he and Jacques bached together,
and tied his horse. There was a cheery light coming
out of the windows, and that seemed odd, seeing
that Jacques was likely dead somewheres up the trail.
And what seemed stranger, there was someone singing
inside, and every now and then a woman’d laugh.
God! man, did you ever hear a woman laughing
when your heart had been aching for weeks?</p>

<p>“‘Beats the devil!’ Narcisse thought, ‘how quick
folks fill your place when you’re dead!’ Gave him a
tight feeling in the throat to think how someone was
laughing inside, and Jacques somewheres up trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with the coyotes sniffing at him and the snow blowing
over him all day and all night!</p>

<p>“Then Narcisse slips up quiet as could be to the
window and peeps in. He falls back like someone
had hit him hard in the face. But nobody had. All
he saw inside was Paulette and Jacques!</p>

<p>“Narcisse leans against the cabin, dazed like, for
quite a spell. Seemed like he couldn’t get it all
through his head at once. Then he saw it all&mdash;the
cards had been stacked on him. He should’ve been
dead and he wasn’t. That was the trouble.</p>

<p>“Didn’t cuss Jacques even then, Narcisse didn’t.
Wasn’t mad&mdash;just ached in his chest like. And by
and by he goes up to the window and taps on it with
his fingers. And Jacques comes out into the starlight,
whistling.</p>

<p>“When he runs into Narcisse a-tottering around
the corner like a drunken man, he gasps and leans
against the cabin, a-holding on to it and staring.</p>

<p>“‘Good God!!’ he wheezes. ‘Good God!’</p>

<p>“‘Old pard,’ says Narcisse; and his voice was
like it had smoke in it, ‘you win; I pass; mine’s a
bob-tail flush; but you stacked the deck!’</p>

<p>“‘For Christ’s sake, Narcisse,’ whispers Jacques,
‘don’t let her see you! Don’t let her hear you!
Come on!’</p>

<p>“And he takes down toward the river, a-walking
like the devil was after him; but it wasn’t anybody
but Narcisse, limping a little with the bad leg.</p>

<p>“And when they came to the river Jacques didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
seem to have anything to say but ‘O, it’s a devil
of a mess! A hell of a mess!’ Said it over and
over like he was half crazy. And Narcisse said:
‘Last fall I’d have killed the man who’d said this
about you, Jacques. It isn’t the girl so much,
Jacques; but you and I have starved and frozen
together many’s the time, and we always split fair
till now. It was hard sledding up there without the
grub and with only one leg. You stole the cards on
me this deal, Jacques; but I’m not going to call for
a new deal. I’ll play the hand.’</p>

<p>“Just that way Narcisse said it. And with
Jacques muttering, ‘O, it’s a devil of a mess,’ they
came to an air hole where the black water was gurgling
and chuckling.</p>

<p>“And all at once Jacques flared up and snarled:
‘Why in hell didn’t you die?’ And slashing out
with a long knife, he made a long gash in Narcisse’s
scalp, and gave him a shove toward the hole. But he
didn’t go in, Narcisse didn’t. He’s got that scar yet,
but he’s got a deeper one where nobody sees.</p>

<p>“And then Narcisse somehow forgot the long
trails they’d tramped together and the starvings and
the freezings together. Couldn’t think of anything
but the sting of the knife and the trickle of the blood.
And the white starlight swam round him like water
in a suck hole, and got red like blood, and buzzed
and hummed. And he was a better man than Jacques&mdash;better
fighter. And when the light quit swimming
around and got white again and the stillness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
frozen night came back, Narcisse found himself sobbing
and turning his heel round and round in somebody’s
mouth. And it was Jacques.</p>

<p>“And what does Narcisse get?”</p>

<p>The man, after finishing his tale, took a handkerchief
from his pocket, carefully placed it about his
throat like a halter, threw his head to one side and
simulated strangulation.</p>

<p class="p2">We didn’t tell any more stories after that. When
night came we rolled up in our blankets, after having
made a rousing fire. I did not sleep much that night.
The man did, however. He was the coolest I ever
saw. Went to sleep like a child, knowing full well
that he too had a noose awaiting him.</p>

<p>When I was sure that he was sound asleep, I got
up and carefully took off his bearskin cap, which
he had not removed night or day since we had been
together.</p>

<p>I saw by the blue glow of the falling embers that
which I had expected to see&mdash;a long, ugly gash running
across his scalp. It was not yet quite healed.</p>

<p>In the morning, as the storm had died in the night,
we saddled up. “You take the mule and go on
ahead,” I said; “I’ll probably catch up with you by
noon.”</p>

<p>The man obeyed. I did not expect to catch up
with him, but along about noon I overtook him.</p>

<p>“You seem determined to travel my way,” I said.
He stared at me for some time, and then said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
quietly: “I’m not a coward just because I’m going
to hang.”</p>

<p>And we rode on together.</p>

<p>The next morning when we had saddled up, I said:
“<i>Narcisse</i>, here is one of my six-shooters and some
ammunition. There is the grub. If you travel west
far enough, you will come at last to the gold country.
Ever think of going to the gold country?”</p>

<p>The man gasped and placed his hand to his head.
“When did I have my cap off?” said he.</p>

<p>“You have a good mule there,” continued I, evading
his question. “You have grub, a gun and ammunition.
Why don’t you go west?”</p>

<p>“Why are you saying that?” he said.</p>

<p>“Because,” I answered, “because I have seen
<i>both scars</i>!”</p>

<p>A light came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“And you?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I?” said I; “well <i>I</i>, while conducting a prisoner
southward, was attacked by Indians. The
prisoner was killed while defending me with unusual
bravery. I lost all my grub, one gun, some ammunition
and a mule. I barely escaped with my life, and
rode like the very devil to get to the next post. <i>Go!</i>”</p>

<p>I pointed west. The man slowly fastened the
grub sack on his mule, mounted, gave me a look
which I have never forgotten, and rode west.</p>

<p>I have never seen him since. As for me, I got into
the next post that evening with a worn-out horse and
a tale of calamity.</p>

<h2 class="p4">V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE FADING OF SHADOW FLOWER</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">SHE was only a timid little Omaha maiden with
a pair of pensive eyes, dark like the thunder
clouds, and like them, fraught with a potential
fire that seemed ever about to spend its fury in
the weakness of tears. She passed her childhood
hours beside the singing streams and in the lonesome
places where the silence lingered. The sunrise
and the sunset found her where the wild flowers
clustered, or where the noises of the nesting birds
disturbed the stillness of the thickets. For hers was
a timorous soul, and the dumb kindness of the green
things was sweet to her.</p>

<p>So, as she grew in this wise toward that mysterious
time when the immaturity of the girl bursts into
the magic of the woman, her people said: “She
talks with the things that talk not; she plays with
the wind that sleeps and moans in the shadowy
place.” And that is why they named her Shadow
Flower.</p>

<p>In the long, mysterious nights of the winter,
Shadow Flower wept with fear at the mournful cry
of the coyotes, and often through the droning days
of the summer did the harsh warning of the startled
rattlesnake send her trembling in terror to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mother’s breast. Yet, huddled close to the group
about the evening fire, she loved to listen to the
warriors’ tales of the strong arm and the fierce heart;
and her eyes glowed with an unwonted light as her
kinsmen recounted the wild swoop of the ambushed
foe or the silent pursuit, swift and relentless.</p>

<p>All the glowing ideals of manly prowess that her
maiden heart had conjured, were centred in the
person of the fearless brave, Big Axe; for had he
not the eagle glance that went to the heart of an
enemy like an arrow? Was not his the shaggy head
of the buffalo bull that strikes with fear the boldest
hunter? The breath of his sinewy breast was like
a whirlwind when the battle cry awakened in his
throat! There was no arm in all the circled tepees
that could hurl a tomahawk so straight and far; and
none that could heave above the anger of the battle
a war club more ponderous!</p>

<p>“Ah,” she would say to herself, while wandering
alone with her musings, “Big Axe is so great a
man!”</p>

<p>When a band of warriors rode out of the village,
bent upon some petty conquest somewhere beyond
the blue hills that undulated the horizon with their
summits, Shadow Flower would become very lonely,
and she would stand for long hours upon some
larger hill, scanning the dim sky line for the returning
warriors; for where the battle was, there was
Big Axe. And when at last she would catch sight
of the returning band, shouting with the great joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of a battle won, how proudly she stared, and with
what a light in her eyes, at her graceful warrior
astride his swift pony! How anxiously would she
search the headdress of her brave for the fresh eagle
feather that should speak of some late deed done by
the strong arm&mdash;her strong arm!</p>

<p>Yet her timorous little soul alone knew of the
great overflowing passion that she treasured for Big
Axe; unless, perhaps, the birds and the green things
understood her, for hers was a passion that little
words could not carry.</p>

<p>Thus did the frail flower long for the golden
kisses of the sun!</p>

<p>There was war between the Omaha and Ponca
tribes. So it happened one morning, in the time
when the deer tear the earth with their horns, that
Shadow Flower, hunting late blossoms upon the sere
hills where the young Dawn danced, heard below
her the impatient stamp of ponies, and beheld the
mounting of braves, for Big Axe was leading a party
of a hundred warriors against the enemy.</p>

<p>The purple spikes of the ironweed and the yellow
plumes of the golden-rod dropped from her fingers
as she gazed upon the sight below her. What a
sight! It was as the marshalling of the incarnate
Winds from the circle of the heavens. Out of the
dust cloud that arose from the dry earth where four
hundred nervous hoofs fretted with impatience beneath
the restraining thongs, she caught the dazzle
of the sleek and vari-coloured hides of the ponies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
some white with the brilliance of the summer sun
when it glares upon the false lakes of alkali; some
spotted and wiry as the wild cat; some tawny as the
mountain lion; some black like the midnight when
the storm clouds fly.</p>

<p>Their gaunt flanks were heaving with the joy of
speed and power. Their nostrils were distent with
the influx of prairie winds that know no restraining
hand save that of the great invisible Master. They
snorted and reared as if about to plunge in a wild
heat down the winds. Their neighing was the shout
of the tempest in the rocks, and their gusty manes
were as clouds that tatter in the storm.</p>

<p>And amid this <i>mêlée</i> of dust and noise and dazzle
trembled the gaudy headdresses of the warriors,
bright with the painted wing feathers of the eagle
and the hawk.</p>

<p>Now a shout drowns the neighing and the snorting.
A hundred braves leap to the backs of the
plunging ponies. The dust cloud thickens and
sweeps down the valley like a whirlwind. A far
glint of brandished weapons; a dying shout; the
band swoops about the base of a hill. Then the
sultry day drones and drowses on the prairie. The
grasshopper breaks the slumber of the stillness with
his snapping noise; a lone hawk skirts the ground
with slow, circling flight. But Shadow Flower
stands and stares beneath a shading hand into the
brilliance where the warriors vanished. Her ears
hear not the snarl and hum of the drowsy bugs, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the shrill chatter of the sly gopher as it rears its
striped body from the grass and peers about. She
sees not the circling hawk and scarcely does the glitter
of the yellow grass hurt her eyes. For her ears
are filled with the shout that has died, and in her
eyes a sinewy, masterful brave urges a black pony
down the valley.</p>

<p>After a while her hand dropped from her eyes,
and catching sight of the circling hawk, she cried:
“O you who are so keen of eye, tell me, can you
not see into the heart of Muzape Tunga [Big Axe]?
O you who are so keen of thought, tell me, does he
think of Pazha Hu [Shadow Flower]?”</p>

<p>But the hawk circled far away and the day
droned on.</p>

<p>Among the hills, hidden from one who looked and
saw not, the war party rode on with the noses of
its ponies to that portion of the sky from which the
red sun of summer springs, for in that direction lay
the village of the Poncas, perched upon the yellow
bluffs of the great muddy river.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day the air grew soft
with the scent of flowing waters, and the Omahas,
checking their ponies upon the brow of a hill, beheld
to their right the swirling stream, red with the last
light of the day; and before them, across a deep
hollow, the village of the Poncas, upon the summit
of a bluff.</p>

<p>But while their eyes wandered over the misty
stretches of the river, a wild shout startled the calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the scene, while from the village on the opposite
summit a line of mounted warriors issued, taking
the precipitous hillside at a brisk gallop.</p>

<p>The sudden shout and the beat of flying hoofs
hurled the weary ponies of the Omahas back upon
their haunches. Yet scarcely had the echoes of the
shout cried their last among the distant bluffs, when
a hundred Omaha bow thongs twanged and a hundred
arrows shrieked their shrill death-song in the
quiet evening air. A second and a third flight of
arrows, and the rushing Poncas were thrown into
confusion. Those in the rear were thrown by the
floundering bodies of the wounded ponies in the
front, the fury of their momentum hurling them
pellmell into the valley below. Then the Omahas
swept down the valley, as the eagle sweeps, with the
battle cry upon their lips, and the remnant of the
attacking Poncas turned and fled up the steep hillside
to their village.</p>

<p>The village of the Poncas, in addition to its strong
position, was further fortified by stockades, constructed
of saplings driven into the ground with their
tops sharpened. The fugitives having gained the
protection of this barrier, were safe from further
pursuit, and emboldened by their protection, they
hurled such a flight of arrows into the ranks of the
enraged Omahas that the latter were obliged to
withdraw beyond arrow flight, contenting themselves
with taunting their besieged foes by displaying the
dripping scalps of the fallen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the influence of the fading evening cooled
the anger and hushed the shouting. From the
height whither the assaulting band withdrew to
camp, one could hurl the triumphant gaze unnumbered
bowshots westward, athwart the brown hills
that seemed to have been stricken motionless in
liquid turbulence by the enchantment of the sunset,
marvellous with the pomp of streamers, violet, purple,
saffron, sanguine, dun!</p>

<p>Far up the river the blue haze of the sky-fringed
woodland blended into the purple shadow beneath
the contrasting yellow of the bluffs, that looked
down into the smooth waters, upon their own
scarred and wrinkled images crowned with golden
crowns by the last scant sunlight. The cottonwoods
placed their long shadows like soothing fingers on
the muddy madness of the central stream. The
Night awakened in the east and stretched its long
black arms into the west, and the glory vanished.
The distant woodland and the bluffs grew into indistinguishable
masses. The river became a faint film
above a lower concave of dawning stars. The camp
fires in the village reared long towers of light into
the darkness, then fell back into a sleepy glow.</p>

<p>One dreaming out a sunset on the prairie cannot
wonder at the exquisite hyperbole of the Omaha
language; that tongue nurtured amid marvellous possibilities
of fury and calm, of beauty and terror, all
within the sight-tiring circle of stupendous distance.</p>

<p>The dawn came, and by the first light the Poncas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
beheld their enemies camped across the valley.
Upon one side the bluff fell sheer to the river; upon
the other lingered a cruel and patient foe. So it
happened that after many days, moans of suffering
arose from the lodges on the bluff; and the Omahas
laughed in their tepees, for the sound of an enemy’s
wailing is sweet. The sweltering suns of the prairie
September beat upon the bare summit where the
village pined, and the lips of the Poncas burned with
thirst, while their eyes drank of the copious floods
far below them.</p>

<p>So it chanced one day, when a cry went up through
the village: “Our children are dying of thirst; let
us beg mercy of our enemies!” that an unarmed
brave passed out of the village and across the valley
toward the camp of his foes. With tottering step
he approached the tepee before which Big Axe
waited. His lips were swollen and cracked; his eyes
were bleared and sunken, yet they glared as the eyes
of a wolf from the darkness of a cavern.</p>

<p>In a hoarse, inarticulate whisper he spoke to the
chief: “Pity my people, for they are dying of
thirst!”</p>

<p>There was lightning in the eyes of Muzape
Tunga. “Badger!” he hissed; and he struck the
suppliant down before him.</p>

<p>The sun burned down the glaring blue of the west.
A continuous wail arose from the suffering village
like the cry of pines in a gentle wind; while from
the tepees of the besiegers came the sound of merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
laughter that mocked like the babble of inaccessible
waters.</p>

<p>But when the red sun touched the tops of the far
hills, another form left the enclosure of the village
and took its way down the hillside. As it came
nearer, a hush of awe fell upon the Omahas. The
form was that of a squaw! With an unfaltering
movement she approached, seeming to hover through
the mist that arose from the valley. Slowly she
climbed the hillside. Not a sound passed the lips
of the beholders. They seemed the figures of one
dream gazing at the central idea of another. The
form emerged from the mist and stood, swathed in
the chromatic radiance of the evening before the
motionless figure of Muzape Tunga. The eyes of
the woman and the chief met in unwavering stare.
Had the glance of the former become vocal, it would
have been a song with the softness of the mother’s
lullaby, but with a meaning terrible as the battle cry
of a brave.</p>

<p>With a langorous movement the woman raised
her arms, thus allowing the many-coloured skin that
hung about her shoulders to slip to the ground, exposing
all the dumb eloquence of her brown breasts.
Out of the silence her voice broke like the voice of
a sudden wind that rises in the night.</p>

<p>“Nunda Nu [Man-Heart] fears not Muzape
Tunga!”</p>

<p>The chief saw the lithe young form, heard the
soft, caressing voice and shivered with great passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>A swift smile crossed the face of the young
woman, soft as a last ray of sunlight on a hill.
Again the voice grew out of the hush.</p>

<p>“The heart of Muzape Tunga is strong like
his arm and kind like his eye; he will spare my
people.”</p>

<p>The chief’s great breast heaved with the pleasure
of his eye and ear. “Nunda Nu has the heart of a
man and the eye of a woman,” he said; “her voice
is soft like the song of a forest stream; Muzape
Tunga spares her people.”</p>

<p>Nunda Nu turned her face to her village and
made a signal with her uplifted hands. Soon an
unarmed Ponca, manifestly a chief by his garments,
was seen taking his way down the hillside.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Nunda Nu, turning to Big Axe;
“my father bears the pipe of peace; let us meet him
in the valley.”</p>

<p>Without a word the chief followed the young
woman, while his warriors stared after in wonderment.
In the valley, midway between the village
and the camp, the chiefs met. Then both sitting
cross-legged upon the grass, the Ponca lit the pipe
of peace, and having puffed silently for a while,
handed it to his conqueror. The sweet smoke of the
red willow arose slowly over the silent three, and
Big Axe stared abstractedly into the mounting vapour.
The evening grew old. The sunlight left
the summits of the hills and the shadows deepened.
Still Big Axe did not speak, but gazed with wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
eyes into the ascending cloud of smoke. The heart
of the terrible warrior had grown tender; a light
softer than the twilight was in his eye. It seemed
that he could hear the slumberous, singing voice of
a squaw and the prattle of children about the door
of his lodge. There were pictures for him in the
rising smoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly he took the pipe from his mouth and returned
it to the Ponca chief.</p>

<p>“We will bury the tomahawk,” he said; “our
ponies shall sweat no more in the battle, but in the
paths of the bison. No more shall our faces be cruel
with warpaint.”</p>

<p>Again there was silence but for the rhythmic puffing
of the Ponca’s pipe. Again Muzape Tunga
spoke, and his voice was sonorous with passion.</p>

<p>“The eyes of Nunda Nu are deep and dark as a
mountain lake; her voice is a song that the slow
winds sing in the willows. Give me Nunda Nu that
my lodge may be filled with laughter; give her to
Muzape Tunga that peace may be everlasting between
us!”</p>

<p>There was a silence. The Ponca forgot his pipe;
he puffed deliberately and at long intervals. The
ascending smoke dwindled to a thin grey thread.
With steadfast gaze the smoker looked before him
into the darkness, for his thoughts were deep.</p>

<p>At length he laid the pipe upon the grass and
arose to his feet, extending his hand to Big Axe.
His voice was tremulous as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Muzape Tunga asks a great thing of his conquered
brother; had he asked for a hundred ponies,
with feet fleet as the winds in winter, his brother
would have laughed at the little gift. Nunda Nu is
my life; I give my life to my brother.”</p>

<p>Already the night had spread into the west and
the darkness hid their parting.</p>

<p class="p2">Some days afterward at sunset, an Omaha maiden
stood upon a hill near her village. With hand at
brow she peered into the blue distance. Suddenly a
cry of delight trembled on her lips. A cloud of dust
had grown far away upon the verge of a hill to the
northeast, slowly resolving itself into a long line
of warriors approaching at a gallop. The column
drew nearer. The face of the watching maiden grew
darker with anxiety, as a brilliant cloud darkens
when the twilight fails. She beheld the masterful
form of Big Axe mounted upon a black pony, riding
in advance of the band; yet her face darkened. Her
brows lowered with the strain of her intense gaze.
Was it a squaw that rode upon a pony white as a
summer cloud beside her warrior?</p>

<p>A shout went up from the village below. The
speed of the ponies was increased to a fast gallop;
the band swept up the valley. A strange low cry
fell from the lips of the maiden; a stifled cry like
that of a sleeping brave who feels the knife of the
treacherous foeman at his heart.</p>

<p>In the village was the sound of many glad voices;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
but in the darkness of the hill above, a frail form
buried its face in the dry bunch grass and uttered a
moan that no one heard.</p>

<p class="p2">The autumn passed: the cold winds came down
from the north, shaking the snow from their black
wings, and the people of the village began to look
upon Shadow Flower with awe. For never a word
had she spoken to anyone since the returning of the
band in the fall. With a dull light in her eyes she
wandered about muttering to herself: “It was summer
when they left; now the prairie is so cold and
white, so cold and white.”</p>

<p>Absent-mindedly she would dwell upon the bitter
words, gazing beneath an arched hand into the cold,
white glare of the horizon. Then her eyes, at times,
would blaze with gladness. “Shonga saba! Shonga
saba!” (a black pony) she would cry ecstatically;
and for one intense moment her frail form would
be erect and quivering with joy. Then the light in
her eye would fade as the fires fade in a camp that
is deserted; a cry of anguish would fall from her
lips, her hand would drop lifelessly from her brow.
“No,” she would sigh languidly; “no, it is only a
cloud! O, the prairie is so cold and white, so cold
and white!”</p>

<p>And the old people shook their heads and whispered
to each other: “The soul of Pazha Hu has
followed the summer, for her soul loved the flowers;
can you not hear her body crying for her soul?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>When the warm winds came again and the hills
were green, the crying of a young child was heard
in the lodge of Muzape Tunga. The simple heart
of the stern warrior throbbed with gladness as a
cold seed throbs with the blowing of the south
wind.</p>

<p>But the sound of the infant’s voice brought no
summer to the heart of Nunda Nu. The touch of its
little brown hands stung her breasts, and as she
looked upon its face, placid or expressive as its
dreams took form or slept, a cold shudder ran
through her veins as when one gazes on a snake,
for it was the child of an enemy.</p>

<p>All through the long winter a slow hate had
sapped the kindness from the heart of the future
mother; and when she felt the new life throbbing
into form, her thoughts grew bitter. So now the
unforgotten moaning of the children of her people,
dying with thirst upon the barren summit, was loud
enough to drown the prattle of her enemy’s child,
which should have wrought enchantment in her
blood.</p>

<p>One night a noiseless shadow passed among the
tepees hushed in slumber beneath the moonlight.
It crept up to the tepee of Muzape Tunga and
crouched beside it in an attitude of listening. The
bugs chirped and hummed, the frogs croaked, the
wolves howled far away; save these and a sleeper’s
heavy breathing, there was silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a faint sound as of someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
moving in the tepee; the shadow outside arose and
the moonlight fell upon its haggard face, the face
of Shadow Flower. She placed her eye to a small
opening in the skins that covered the poles. Now
she would gaze upon the child of Muzape Tunga!</p>

<p>Through the opening at the top of the tepee the
moonlight entered with intense brilliance and fell
upon three faces. One was the face of her once
sweet dream and the face that trembled through the
visions of her madness, Muzape Tunga’s. One was
the beautiful, cruel face of her who came upon a
pony white as a summer cloud that autumn evening
when the sunlight left the prairie. One was a face
that she had not seen before, yet her poor heart
ached as she looked upon it. It was the face of his
child, her child. Ah, it should have been the child
of Shadow Flower, she thought, and her brain reeled
with sudden madness.</p>

<p>As she looked, the woman in the tepee raised herself
upon her elbow. She gazed upon the peaceful
face of Big Axe. The moon lit up her features in
clear relief. Her eyes were terrible with hate; the
lids drawn closely about them until they had the
small beady appearance of the snake’s. Her lips
were drawn closely cross her white teeth in a cold
grin. Her form trembled as with a chill, yet the
night was warm. Then she arose, and with a noiseless
step, sought for something that hung upon the
side of the tepee. She returned clutching a tomahawk.
The light caught her whole form, making it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
stand out, clear-cut like a statue, the statue of a
prairie Judith.</p>

<p>Then she bent over the sleeping Muzape Tunga
for one moment. There was a dull sound as the
weapon entered the sleeper’s skull; but more than
this there was no sound, no groan. And the one
who stood like a shadow without the tepee was
stricken dumb with fright.</p>

<p>The woman within turned to the sleeping child
and raised the dripping tomahawk; but her arm
seemed to freeze in act to strike, and the blow did
not fall. A strange soft light crept over the face
of the woman. She lowered her arm and laid the
weapon aside. Then with the step of a wild-cat she
crept to the entrance of the tepee and, gazing cautiously
about for a moment, slipped silently into the
haze of the moonlight, and was engulfed in the darkness
of the valley.</p>

<p>As the dim outline of the fleeing squaw mixed
itself with the uncertain haze and vanished, a great
happiness leaped into the stagnant veins of Shadow
Flower, and her blood rushed like a stream when
the ice melts with the breath of the south wind.</p>

<p>Even the thought that Big Axe lay dead within
the tepee did not quell her happiness, for she said
to herself: “Now Pazha Hu shall have her warrior;
he shall be all hers.”</p>

<p>She crept into the tepee and, kneeling, put her lips
to the chilling lips of Big Axe. He did not breathe.
She placed her arms about his body, her face against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his breast, yet he did not move. He lay quietly with
the intense moonlight upon his face. She did not
sob, she was almost happy; for did she not at last
possess that for which she had pined?</p>

<p>Her musings were broken by the crying of the
child. She took it in her arms and held it to her
breast, humming a low lullaby, half-persuaded that
the child was her own. But the child was frightened
by the strange voice and cried piteously. Then
Shadow Flower thought, “It cries for its father, yet
its father has gone.” “Hush!” she said to the
child; “we will go and find the soul of Muzape
Tunga; it cannot be far away.”</p>

<p>She wrapped a blanket about the infant, muffling
its cries, and tied it about her shoulders. Then she
went silently through the village and out into the
open prairie, weird with the blue haze of the moon
and the lonesome cries of the wolves.</p>

<p>A rabbit hopped past and stopped near her as if
gazing at the maiden.</p>

<p>“O Rabbit!” cried Shadow Flower, “tell me,
have you seen the soul of Muzape Tunga?”</p>

<p>The rabbit, awed by the strangeness of the voice,
moved its long ears; then it hopped away into the
shades. The maiden followed and was swallowed
in the moonlit mist.</p>

<p class="p2">When the sun looked into the village, the women
were stricken with terror and the men with anger.
The wise people shook their heads by which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
say: “Ah, yes; we thought such things of Nunda
Nu.”</p>

<p>The days passed; the moons came and went; yet
Shadow Flower did not return. There was a common
thought concerning her disappearance which
was never spoken aloud; but when the fires burned
low and the night grew late, it was often whispered
with awe:</p>

<p>“She has gone in search of her soul; it fled last
year with the summer.”</p>

<p class="pch">THE ART OF HATE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">MANY tales have been told of noble sacrifice
for love, and I have seen such in my time;
but I have in mind an instance in which a
man reached a sublime height through the least exalted
of human passions&mdash;hate.</p>

<p>There are some who argue that love is born at
first sight. However that be, I am certain that it is
often thus with hate. I have seen men in my time
the first sight of whom was an insult to me&mdash;sudden,
stinging like a slap on the cheek. It is a strange
thing, and I have never heard it explained satisfactorily.
Sometimes in my own case I have attributed
it to even so slight a thing as a certain turn of the
nose, a curve of the lip, a droop of the eye. And
again I have felt that it was due to nothing visible
about the man, but rather to some subtle emanation
from the very soul of him, that maddened me as
though I had inhaled the fumes of some devilish
drug. Have you ever felt this?</p>

<p>Well, I am telling you about Zephyr Recontre.</p>

<p>He was a little, wiry half-breed, with a French
father and a woman of the Blackfeet tribe for a
mother. Quite a promising combination, if you think
it over! I came across him ’way up at Fort Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in the early ’30’s, when I was in charge of a keel
boat of the American Fur Company. He was employed
at the Fort as interpreter, being a fluent
speaker of several Indian tongues as well as English
and French.</p>

<p>His forehead was a narrow strip of brown between
his wiry black hair and the continuous streak
of black that was his eyebrows. His eyes were large
and black and quiet. His cheek bones were prominent
and his jaw was so heavy as to throw his whole
face out of balance, as you might say. The face of
a stayer, you know. Never said much except as his
duties demanded, and then he went straight to the
point with a quiet directness that left little need for
a question.</p>

<p>Superb little animal he was, too; had the maximum
strength with the minimum weight, and a cool
head to run it with. I never saw him impelled by
sudden anger except once, and that is where the story
begins.</p>

<p>In the spring of ’39 I took charge of the steamboat
<i>Yellowstone</i>, as captain. We were loaded with
supplies for the American Fur Company’s posts on
the upper Missouri, and carried a number of <i>engagés</i>
of the Company, and a certain Frenchman,
Jules Latour, who had been appointed <i>bourgeois</i>
of the old Fort Union, and was going up to take
charge.</p>

<p>If there ever was an emperor in this country it
was J. J. Astor, the head of the Company at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and his empire was spread pretty much all over the
white space on the map of the West as it stood then.
The <i>bourgeois</i>, masters of the trading posts, were the
proconsuls, and they acted the part.</p>

<p>The <i>engagés</i>, humble servants of the empire, were
as dogs about the feet of these Western princes, who
stalked through their provinces, mountain-high in
aristocratic aloofness.</p>

<p>Latour outprinced princeliness. He felt his dignity
and dressed it; his presence on the boat was like
a continual blowing of trumpets going before a conqueror.
A capital “I” swaggering in broadcloth&mdash;that
was Latour!</p>

<p>Recontre was going back with us, having dropped
down to St. Louis the fall before on Company business.
I happened to be near when master and man
first met on the forward deck. They stared upon
each other for only a moment; but there were years
of hate condensed in that bit of time, the master
casting a contemptuous glance from beneath lids
scornfully drooped, and the servant meeting this with
a sudden glare of black fire.</p>

<p>Not a word was passed; Recontre made no sign
of obeisance, passing on with a sullen swing, his jaws
set firmly, his eyes brilliant as with a smouldering fire
blown by a gusty wind into a baleful glow.</p>

<p>It was a plain case of hate at first sight. A week
later, after we had passed St. Mary’s, I was standing
on the hurricane deck, gazing downstream where
the colours of a quiet sunset swept the waters. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
heard an angry snarl below me, and looking down,
I saw Recontre lift the struggling Latour in his arms
and hurl him into the river.</p>

<p>I immediately stopped the boat and ordered a
crew to man the yawl and rescue Latour, at the same
time having Recontre seized.</p>

<p>Latour came aboard coughing and spitting, a most
ludicrous object. But to my surprise, he immediately
commanded that Recontre should be released. I
wondered much at this at the time; but ten years
later I had a talk with Recontre, which threw some
light on the subject. He was leaving the country,
and, as we had become close friends, he did not
hesitate to tell me what he had kept a close secret
for years.</p>

<p>We were taking a friendly glass together at a St.
Louis bar, when I purposely brought up the name
of Jules Latour, who had starved to death some years
before in a mackinaw boat that got caught in the ice
far up the river. I had heard stories of how Recontre,
who was with Latour on the trip, had shown
a faithfulness to his master equalled only by the faithfulness
of a dog to a man. This had always seemed
strange to me, and so I brought up Jules Latour.</p>

<p>At the sound of the name I saw the black fire
grow up in my companion’s eyes, just as I had seen
it ten years before on the forward deck of the <i>Yellowstone</i>.</p>

<p>“You got that story, too, did you?” he said
dreamily, staring straight ahead of him as into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
great distance. “Well, it’s all over now, and for
the first time, I am going to tell the truth about
the death of Latour and my great faithfulness.
When I first saw that man, I felt as though he had
struck me between the eyes with his white fist. I
hated him as I had never hated before, and as I
hope never to hate again. It hurts to hate; it eats
into a man like some incurable blood disease.</p>

<p>“You saw me throw him into the water. I can
hardly explain why I did that; only, the man spoke
to me in a way that insulted me more than if he
had blackguarded my mother. It wasn’t in the words,
for I have forgotten what he said.</p>

<p>“We hated each other. I knew how much I
hated, but I did not know how great was his hate
until he smilingly ordered my release. I knew then
that his hate was a great hate&mdash;stronger than love
can be. And also I knew that this hate would grow
until one of us was killed. And it did.”</p>

<p>“What!” said I; “did <i>you</i> kill Latour?”</p>

<p>Recontre smiled one of his enigmatic smiles and
said quietly: “<i>Nature</i> killed Latour; <i>I</i> merely
helped Nature!”</p>

<p>And then he laughed softly, while the black fire
grew again in his eyes.</p>

<p>Recontre led the way to a table in the back of
the room and we sat down, when he began talking
rapidly, never hesitating in his story, and seeming,
at times, wholly unconscious of my presence.</p>

<p>“When we arrived at Fort Union,” said he, “no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one could have guessed the hate that we nursed
for each other. Being a new man in the country,
Latour consulted me upon many phases of the business,
and we were much together. The whole post
considered me a most favoured person; little knowing,
as I did, that hate can bind two persons as
closely as love.</p>

<p>“My hatred for the man made his a most fascinating
personality to me; and I often found him
studying my face with a diabolical fondness.</p>

<p>“Latour heaped favours upon me, and I received
them with a strange gladness of heart that even now
I cannot explain. One day in November he sent
for me to come to his office. I found him in a mood
seemingly most agreeable. His face beamed with
a light that any other would have taken for kindness.
I saw in it only the ecstatic anticipation of triumph.
And when he spoke I knew that I was right.</p>

<p>“‘My dear Recontre,’ said he, ‘it seems that I
am forced to fall back upon you for everything. I
have a difficult task on hand, and you are the one
man to perform it; I know of no other so peculiarly
fitted for it. I shall carefully lay before you the
dangers of the mission I have in mind, leaving you
free to consent or refuse just as you see fit. Perhaps
the undertaking is impossible. It may be that no
man is sufficiently equipped with strength and daring
to do what I wish. You shall decide.’</p>

<p>“You see he imagined that he was wheedling me
through my vanity. He then stated that he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to open trade with the Blackfeet tribe. He drew
strongly upon his imagination to explain the great
dangers in store for him who should undertake the
task. The Blackfeet were at that time deadly enemies
of the whites. They had killed and mutilated a
number of traders. I would of course stand a poor
chance of coming back alive. He was convinced of
that.</p>

<p>“‘Will you go, Recontre?’ said he, staring
steadily into my eyes.</p>

<p>“I was dumbfounded at the audacity of the man.
I saw the light of doubt wavering in his eyes; but I
did not wish to flinch before my enemy.</p>

<p>“‘Certainly,’ said I; ‘and I will go alone!’</p>

<p>“I saw the triumph glisten in his eye.</p>

<p>“‘Very well,’ said he; ‘you may start in the
morning. Make your own arrangements. I give
you full power to transact the business in hand as
your wisdom may dictate.’</p>

<p>“And I started in the morning. Two weeks later
I returned, successful beyond all hope. I not only
brought back a band of the leading men of the tribe
for a council, but I brought also a young woman
for my wife. I called her Pelagie after one of my
sisters.</p>

<p>“As I think of it now it seems miraculous that I
succeeded. I am half convinced that I was inspired
from out the profundity of my hate to do and say the
right things.</p>

<p>“Latour played skilfully the part of gratitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
joy, but I saw, nevertheless, the deep, devilish disappointment
that he felt. And I was very glad, for
I had conquered in this first combat; and also Pelagie
was a pleasant woman.</p>

<p>“As the winter deepened, Latour and I became
more and more inseparable. We outdid each other
in acts of seeming kindness, until all the post was
jealous of my intimacy with the master.</p>

<p>“They little guessed how we played a ghastly
game that would be finished only when one of us
could smirk and flatter no more.</p>

<p>“The winter grew bitter; heavy snows fell. And
I wondered much what great honour Latour would
heap upon me next, seeing that I was so capable and
willing. Near Christmas Latour called me to his
office, and the light of anticipated triumph was upon
his face.</p>

<p>“‘My friend,’ said he; ‘I do not wish to impose
upon you, but I have in mind a great service that
you may render me, as a friend, mind you, Recontre.
I am sure that you will succeed unless you
freeze to death or get killed by the Indians. None
but a brave man would attempt what I shall mention.
I have a very important communication to forward
to the office at St. Louis. It must be there before
the middle of March or the Company will suffer
heavy losses. If you can get this there at the time
stated, you shall be advanced considerably, with a
raise of wages. Now how would you like being my
private clerk?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I stared into Latour’s eyes and saw all hell deep
down in them.</p>

<p>“‘Give me a good dog to carry my bedding,’ said
I, ‘and I will be at St. Louis by the middle of
March,’ and then I thanked him extravagantly for
this last and greatest of favours. All the time I
hated the man more pitilessly than ever before because
of his shallowness in hoping to flatter me into
getting myself frozen to death.</p>

<p>“I started the next day with 1700 miles of frozen
prairie before me. I felt a strange joy at the thought
of my hardships. Once again I would have the joy
of seeing disappointment in the eyes of my enemy,
and my soul could laugh again. I say I was glad to
go, even though I was obliged to leave Pelagie behind
at a time when the post was ravaged with the
smallpox.</p>

<p>“It was a trip to make one love hell by comparison.
Nothing but my hate sustained me. On March
10th I delivered the written message to the official
at St. Louis. He read it wonderingly.</p>

<p>“‘What!’ said he; ‘have you walked from Union
to deliver <i>this</i>?’</p>

<p>“I stated that I had and he shook his head,
frowned and dismissed me. I never knew what was
in that message. I surmise that it was nothing of
much importance.</p>

<p>“When the first boat started up the river for the
North I went with it and arrived at Fort Union in
late June. Latour was at the landing when the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pulled in. He threw his arms about my neck and
actually kissed me upon the cheek. He then and
there made me his private clerk with my former
salary doubled. He treated me as a brother.</p>

<p>“But I saw in the depth of his eyes the soul-fret
of a wounded beast.</p>

<p>“When we reached his office walking arm in arm,
he gently told me of the serious sickness of Pelagie,
and how he had looked after her like a brother
through the hard winter.</p>

<p>“I hurried to my home. I found Pelagie delirious
with the fever of smallpox. All that night I sat
beside her, my heart aching, for I felt that she would
die.</p>

<p>“And for the time I forgot my hate for Latour,
until, in her feverish tossing about, she threw her
bare arm over the side of the bed. Then I saw that
which made me shiver with a desire to kill. There
was a scratch on the arm, and the flesh about it was
swollen and blue. It came to me that Latour had
caused her to be inoculated that she might die before
my return, and thus make my heart sore that he
might see.</p>

<p>“I grasped the dirk and ran wildly out of the
house in search of Latour. I reached his door.
Then I faltered. It was not fear that made me
falter. It was that I knew my revenge could not be
completed in this way. I wanted to see him suffer
more than I had ever suffered. Also I wished to
come away with clean hands. I did not know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it could be done then, but I trusted to some mysterious
power that had seemed to be with me all through
my terrible winter tramp.</p>

<p>“I stole back to the bedside of Pelagie. She died
at dawn.</p>

<p>“Latour mourned with me. He wept and spoke
touchingly of his own wife. I gritted my teeth and
strained every nerve to keep from choking him.</p>

<p>“The summer passed. Latour was so kind that
I often found it an effort to keep alive my belief in
his treachery. And at other times, I was obliged to
leave him abruptly, feeling a madness in my blood
for striking him down, trampling him, tearing him
with my teeth and nails.</p>

<p>“Oh, all the great actors have not appeared upon
the stage! I must confess that Nature and Zephyr
Recontre killed a great actor!</p>

<p>“The fall came, and our friendship did not abate.
I began to fear that my chance would never come,
and I would be obliged to kill him as one brute kills
another. Many nights I lay awake shaping impossible
schemes of revenge that were rejected in the
sanity of the morning.</p>

<p>“In the first week of October I had occasion for
a great joy. Latour called me to his office and stated
that certain conditions of the trade which had been
wholly unforeseen, made it necessary that he should
be in St. Louis before the winter set in. Unfortunately,
the last steamboat had left Fort Union for the
South, making it necessary that the trip be made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a mackinaw boat. Would I, his dearest friend, consent
to accompany him on the trip?</p>

<p>“With a studied reluctance that hid my insane joy,
I consented. Latour left a clerk in charge of affairs,
and we started. We made very slow progress, as
we depended almost entirely upon the current, having
no oars, and there being little wind to fill the
square sail we carried.</p>

<p>“This was as I wished it to be. I kept longing
for the ice to come down and shut us in. Time and
again I managed to run the boat aground on bars in
order to kill time. Latour seemed not to notice this.
In fact, he was unusually pleasant in his bearing
toward me.</p>

<p>“We had a small hut built on the mackinaw, fitted
with two bunks, and a small box stove for cooking.
When we tied up to the shore for the night and
turned in, I was often obliged to choke back laughter
at the comedy that we played&mdash;a grim comedy. Each
of us would at once feign deep slumber, ever now
and then opening our eyes to see how the other slept.
Once our eyes chanced to meet in the dim candle
light of the room, for Latour insisted upon the candle.
We both grinned and rolled over.</p>

<p>“Our understanding seemed perfect; and yet,
owing to the devilish refinement of our mutual hate,
neither really feared any vulgar act of violence from
the other. We knew that the thing would not be
done in that way.</p>

<p>“We had made about five hundred miles down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stream into the very heart of the wilderness, when
the ice began running. Within twenty-four hours
after that, we were frozen in. A heavy snow began
falling and continued for a week. It lay three feet
deep upon the level, and was so light as to make it
impossible to take the trail.</p>

<p>“Latour and I merrily set about to chop wood,
not knowing how long we might be forced to live in
the little cabin of the mackinaw.</p>

<p>“We had brought only about half enough provisions
for the trip, having depended upon hunting for
much of our food, as there was a great deal of game
in those days. The deep snow made it impossible
to get much game, so that in less than two weeks our
little supply of lyed corn was almost exhausted.</p>

<p>“One morning Latour said that he was sick, and
remained in his bunk. At first I looked upon this
with suspicion, thinking that he thus sought to throw
the duties of seeking game wholly upon me, who had
proved myself so capable and willing. But the next
morning I knew it was no sham, for he had a high
fever, and was delirious at times. You see, he had
been used to luxury, and his feeble constitution had
not been equal to the thorough soaking we got while
chopping wood in the deep snow.</p>

<p>“Often in his delirium he linked my name with
bitter curses. At last he had betrayed his hate, and
I smiled, knowing that he would lose the game at
last, since he no longer had the cunning to continue it.</p>

<p>“Again it began to snow; it was a hard winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Much as I might have wished to seek game for my
sick enemy, I could not even seek it for myself.
Nature had taken a hand in the game; I began to
feel her master-touch in the bitter scheme of things.
She seemed determined to starve us both; but I knew
that I could last longer than Latour with his constitution
weakened by too much easy life.</p>

<p>“So I blessed the snow as it deepened. Latour
would die before my eyes; and then afterward I too
would die, the winner of the game. It would be a
most sublime revenge, it seemed to me; for I think I
was hardly sane when I was near Jules Latour. It
would be like Samson crushing his enemies and himself
together. No one could blame me, should our
bodies be found. I would have had my revenge and
still none could blame me.</p>

<p>“There was a small quantity of lyed corn left.
I ate sparingly of this, carefully saving Latour’s
share for him when he should wish to eat.</p>

<p>“One morning he awoke from his delirium; he
asked for food.</p>

<p>“‘I have saved your share for you,’ said I. ‘I
might have eaten it, for I think we shall starve to
death in a week or so. The snow is too deep and
soft for hunting. Still I have divided fair with you,
remembering your great kindness to Pelagie, remembering
your great kindness in allowing me to distinguish
myself among the Blackfeet, remembering your
generosity in allowing me to take your message to
St. Louis. Do you remember?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“He groaned, and his eyes became cold and savage,
like a starved wolf’s.</p>

<p>“I gave him his lyed corn and he ate. His delirium
returned. He cursed Recontre bitterly. He
clenched his feverish, white hands about the imaginary
neck of Zephyr Recontre; and I smiled.</p>

<p>“In two days more all the lyed corn had been
eaten. In the meanwhile the surface of the snow had
hardened with the intense cold. I could have hunted,
for I was not yet too weak, and there was a gun and
plenty of ammunition. But I did not go hunting.
I saw Latour weakening rapidly. He might die during
my absence, and I would thus lose the sweetness
of my revenge. It seemed to me that this would be
like selling my birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>

<p>“I could have taken the gun and gone south over
the snow to Fort Pierre, several hundred miles down
the river. But I did not go. Latour had not died
yet After he died, if I could still walk, I might go.</p>

<p>“All day I sat beside the little box stove, gazing
upon Latour. At night I slept lightly, awakening
often to see how fever and hunger dealt with Latour.
He might die while I slept.</p>

<p>“One day in December, I cannot remember just
when, for I myself was often delirious with hunger,
Latour again awakened from delirium.</p>

<p>“‘Food, food!’ he gasped. ‘For God’s sake,
Recontre, don’t let a man starve like this! Let’s
make it up between us; only give me something to
eat!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“His voice was thin like a sick woman’s. His
face was the face of a damned man.</p>

<p>“‘Make what up?’ I said sweetly. My voice
was also thin. I struggled continuously with a terrible
giddiness. I felt as one in a nightmare. I, too,
was starving.</p>

<p>“Latour stared upon me with tears in his faded
eyes, and groaned. I, too, fetched tears; it was easy
to weep in my weakened condition.</p>

<p>“‘I have no food,’ said I; ‘neither can I go in
search of any. I am starving, and the snow is deep.
Would I not go if I could? Would I not go for <i>you?</i>
Can I forget Pelagie and the Blackfeet trip? Can I
forget the winter trip to St. Louis?’</p>

<p>“Latour fainted. I shouted feebly with an insane
joy; I thought he had died.</p>

<p>“In a few moments he revived, and again begged
piteously for food. I wept, and said there was none.
Then he became delirious and cursed me like a devil.
I never heard such cursing before nor since.</p>

<p>“And the strange thing about it all was that I
pitied Latour. But my hate had become a mania; I
could not relent.</p>

<p>“What passed after that hour I cannot remember
with distinctness. Dreams were real, and reality
was a dream. I only remember in a vague way, as
though it had happened in a nightmare, that Latour
died cursing me; that I sang and shouted; that I
crawled out of the hut on my hands and knees, laughing
and shouting, and that I saw a band of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
coming over the frozen snow from the direction of
Fort Pierre. I remember hearing them call my name
as with the voices of a dream. I remember that I
cried out, ‘Latour has just died!’ And then I remember
laughing and crying, not knowing why I
did.</p>

<p>“I remember that these men gave me food&mdash;warm
food&mdash;and that after a long sleep I awoke and saw a
Jesuit missionary kneeling at my bedside.</p>

<p>“It was then that I tasted the full sweetness of
my triumph. The priest was <i>blessing me!</i> He spoke
of the Christlike kindness of Zephyr Recontre, who
had not deserted his sick master.</p>

<p>“I did not see Latour again. The Jesuit’s party
had chopped a hole in the ice and had given his body
to the river.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SINGER OF THE ACHE</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid"><i>The Old Omaha Speaks</i></p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap04">NOW this is the story of one who walked
not with his people, but with a dream.</p>

<p>To you I tell it, O White Brother, yet
is it not for you, unless you also have followed the
long trail of hunger and thirst&mdash;the trail that leads
to no lodge upon the high places or the low places,
by flowing streams or where the sand wastes lie.</p>

<p>It shall be as the talking of a strange tribe to you,
unless you also have peered down the endless trail,
with eyes that ached and dried up as dust, and felt
your pony growing leaner and shadow-thin beneath
you as you rode, until at last you sat upon a quiet
heap of bones and peered and peered ahead.</p>

<p>Moon-Walker was he called&mdash;he who walked for
the moon. But that was after he had called his pony
from the grazing places and mounted for the long
ride. Yet was there a time when he ran about among
the lodges laughing very merrily with many boys
and girls, who played with hoop and spear, made
little bloodless wars upon unseen peoples, and played
in little ways the big, sad games of men. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
he was called by many names, and all of the names,
though different, meant that he was happy.</p>

<p>But once his mother and his father saw how that
a man began to look out of his eyes, began to hear
a man talking in his throat; and so they said: “It
is the time for him to dream.”</p>

<p>So they sent him at nightfall to the hill of dreams&mdash;as
is the custom of our people.</p>

<p><i>Wahoo!</i> the bitter hill of dreams! Many have
I seen go up there laughing, but always they came
down with halting feet and with sadness in their
faces. And among these many, lo! even I who speak&mdash;therefore
should my words be heard.</p>

<p>And he of the many names went up into the hill
of dreams and dreamed. And in through the mists
that strange winds blow over the hills of sleep burst
a white light, as though the moon had grown so
big that all the sky was filled from rim to rim, leaving
no place for sun and stars. And upon the surface
of the white light floated a face, an awful face&mdash;whiter
than the light upon which it floated; and so
beautiful to see that he of the many happy names
ached through all his limbs, and cried out and woke.
Then leaping to his feet, he gazed about, and all the
stars had grown so small that he looked thrice and
hard before he saw them; and the world was
shrunken.</p>

<p>And frightened at the strangeness of all things,
he fled down the hillside into the village. His
mother and his father he wakened with bitter crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“How came the dream?” they whispered; for
upon the face of him who went up a boy they saw
that which only many years should bring; and in his
eyes there was a strange light.</p>

<p>“A face! a face!” he whispered. “I saw the
face of the Woman of the Moon! Whiter than
snow, it was, and over it a pale flame went! Oh,
never have I seen so fair a face; and there was something
hidden in it swift as lightning; something that
would be thunder if it spoke; and also there was
something kind as rain that falls upon a place of
aching heat. Into the north it looked, high up to
where the lonesome star hangs patient.</p>

<p>“And there was a dazzle of white breasts beneath,
half-hidden in a thin blanket of mist. And on her
head, big drifts of yellow hair; not hanging loose as
does your hair, O mother, but heaped like clouds
that burn above the sunset. My breast aches for
something I cannot name. And now I think that I
can never play again!”</p>

<p>And there was a shaking of heads in that
lodge, and a wondering, for this was not good. Not
so had others, big in deeds, dreamed upon the hill
in former times. Always there had been a coming
of bird, or beast, or reptile, wrapped in the mystery
of strange words; or there had been the cries of
fighting men, riding upon a hissing of hot breaths;
or there had been a stamping of ponies, or the thin,
mad song of arrows.</p>

<p>But here it was not so, and the mother said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Many times the false dreams come at first, and
then at last the true one comes. May it not be so
with him?”</p>

<p>And the father said: “It may be so with him.”</p>

<p>So once again up the hill of dreams went the boy.
And because of the words of his father and mother,
he wept and smeared his face with dust; his muddy
hands he lifted to the stars. And he raised an earnest
voice: “O Wakunda! send me a man’s dream,
for I wish to be a big man in my village, strong to
fight and hunt. The woman’s face is good to see,
but I cannot laugh for the memory of it. And there
is an aching in my breast. O Wakunda! send me
the dream of a man!”</p>

<p class="p2">And he slept. And in the middle of the night,
when shapeless things come up out of the hills, and
beasts and birds talk together with the tongues of
men, his dream came back.</p>

<p>Even as before the moon-face floated in a lake of
cold white fire&mdash;a lake that drowned the stars. And
as he reached to push it from him, lo! like a white
stem growing downward from a flower, a body grew
beneath it! And there was a flashing of white lightning,
and the Woman of the Moon stood before
him.</p>

<p>Then was there a burning in the blood of the boy,
as she stooped with arms held wide; and he was
wrapped about as with a white fire, through which
the face grew down with lips that burned his lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as they touched, and sent pale lightnings flashing
through him.</p>

<p>And as the dream woman turned to run swiftly
back up the star-trails he who dreamed reached out
his arms and clutched at the garments of light that
he might hold the thing that fled, for dearer than
life it seemed to him now.</p>

<p>And he woke. His face was in the dust. His
clutching hands were full of dust.</p>

<p><i>Wahoo!</i> the bitter hill of dreams! Have you
climbed it, O White Brother, even as I?</p>

<p>And in the morning he told the dream to his
father, who frowned; to his mother&mdash;and she wept.
And they said: “This is not a warrior’s dream, nor
is it the dream of a Holy Man; nor yet is it the
vision of a mighty bison hunter. Some strange new
trail this boy shall follow&mdash;a cloudy, cloudy trail!
Yet let him go a third time to the hill&mdash;may not the
true dream linger?”</p>

<p>And the boy went up again; his step was light;
his heart sang wildly in his breast. For once again
he wished to see the Woman of the Moon.</p>

<p>But no dream came. And in the morning the
pinch of grief was upon his face and he shook his
fists at the laughing Day. Then did he and a great
Ache walk down the hill together. All things were
little and nothing good to see. And in among his
people he went, staring with eyes that burned as with
a fever, and lo! he was a stranger walking there!
Only the Dream walked with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>And the sunlight burned the blue, much-beaded
tepee of the sky, and left it black; and as it burned
and blackened, burned and blackened, he who
dreamed the strange dream found no pleasure in
the ways of men. Only in gazing upon the round
moon did he find pleasure. And when even this was
hidden from him for many nights and days he went
about with drooping head, and an ache was in his
eyes.</p>

<p>And in these days he made wild songs; for never
do the happy ones make songs&mdash;they only sing them.
Songs that none had heard he made. Not such as
toilers make to shout about the camp fires when the
meat goes round. Yet was the thick, hot dust of
weary trails blown through them, and cries of dying
warriors, and shrieks of widowed women, and whimpering
of sick <i>zhinga zhingas</i>; and also there was in
them the pang of big man-hearts, the ache of toiling
women’s backs, the hunger, the thirst, the wish to
live, the fear to die!</p>

<p>So the people said: “Who is this <i>nu zhinga</i> who
sings of trails he never followed, of battles he never
fought? No father is he&mdash;and yet he sings as one
who has lost a son! Of the pain of love he sings&mdash;yet
never has he looked upon a girl!”</p>

<p>And it was the way of the boy to answer: “I seek
what I do not find, and so I sing!”</p>

<p>And the nights and days made summers and winters,
and thus it was with the Singer of the Ache.
He grew tall even to the height of a man&mdash;yet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
he no man. For little did he care to hunt, and the
love of battles was not his. Nor his the laughter of
the feast fires. Nor did he look upon the face of
any maiden with soft eyes.</p>

<p>And the father and mother, who felt the first
frosts upon their heads, said: “Our son is now a
man; should he not build a lodge and fill it with a
woman? Should we not hear the laughter of <i>zhinga
zhingas</i> once again before we take the black trail
together?”</p>

<p>And because his father had many ponies, many
maidens were brought before him for his choosing.
But he looked coldly upon them and he said: “The
stars are my sisters and my brothers, and the Moon
is my wife, giving me songs for children. Soon shall
there be a long trail for me.”</p>

<p>Thereat a cry went up against him and more and
more he walked a stranger. Only the Dream walked
with him; and he sang the songs that ache.</p>

<p>Harsh words the father spoke: “Does the tribe
need songs? Can hungry people eat a silly shout,
or will enemies be conquered with a singing?”</p>

<p>But the mother wept and said: “Say not so of
him. Do not his songs bring tears, so strange and
sweet they are at times? Does a man quarrel with
the vessel from which he drinks sweet waters, even
if it be broken and useless for the cooking?”</p>

<p>And the father frowned and said: “Give me
many laughers, and I will conquer all the enemies
and fill all the kettles of the feasts! Let the weepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and makers of tears drag wood with the women.
Always have I been a fighter of battles and a killer
of bison. This is not my son!”</p>

<p>And it happened one night that the Singer stood
alone in the midst of his people, when the round
Moon raised a shining forehead out of the dark,
and grew big and flooded all the hills with white
light. And the Singer raised his arms to it and sang
as one who loves might sing to a maiden coming
forth flashing with many beads from her tepee.</p>

<p>And the people laughed and a mutter ran about:
“To whom does the fool sing thus?”</p>

<p>Soft, shining eyes he turned upon them, and he
said: “Even to the Woman of the Moon! See
where she looks into the North with white face
raised to where the lonesome star hangs patient!”</p>

<p>And the people said: “This is the talk of a fool&mdash;no
woman do we see!”</p>

<p>And then the Singer sang a new song through
which these words ran often: “Only he sees who
can&mdash;only he sees who can!”</p>

<p>So now he walked a fool among his people, singing
the songs that ache.</p>

<p><i>Wahoo!</i> bitter it is to be a fool! And yet, O
White Brother, only they who have been fools are
wise at last!</p>

<p>And it happened one summer that the village was
builded in the flat lands by the Big Smoky Water.
And there came snoring up the stream a <i>monda
geeung</i>, the magic fire-boat of the palefaces. Up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the shore it swam, and they who guided it tied it
to the sand, for its fires were hungry and there was
much wood in our lands.</p>

<p>And all the villagers gathered there to see the
magic swimmer of the palefaces; and among them
came the lonesome singing fool.</p>

<p>And it happened that a woman of the palefaces
came forth and stood high up, and looked upon us,
smiling. White as a snowfall in the late spring was
her face, and her hair was like the sun upon a cloud.
And we all stared wide-mouthed upon her, for never
before had her kind come into the prairies.</p>

<p>Also stared the fool. Even long after all the
people had gone he stared; even until the smoky
breath of the fire-boat writhed like a big black serpent
out of the place where the stream runs out of
the sky.</p>

<p>And then he laid his head upon his knees and
wept; for a longing, bigger than the wish to live,
or the fear to die, had come upon him.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning, when the sleep of all
things is deepest, he arose from sleepless blankets.
He called his pony from the grazing places, and
he mounted for a long ride. Into the North he rode,
and as he rode he talked to himself and to the silence
that clung about him: “It was the Woman of the
Moon! Into the North she went, even unto the
quiet place where the lonesome star hangs patient.
There shall I ride&mdash;there shall I ride! For there do
all my songs take wings and fly; and there at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
their meanings await me. There shall I ride&mdash;there
shall I ride!”</p>

<p>And the fires of the day burned out the stars and
died; downward and inward rushed the black, black
ashes of the night. And still he rode toward the
North.</p>

<p>And like the flashing of a midnight torch through
a hole in a tepee flashed the days and passed. And
still he rode.</p>

<p>Through many villages of strange peoples did he
ride, and everywhere strange tongues and strange
eyes questioned him; and he answered: “Into the
North I ride to find the Woman of the Moon!”</p>

<p>And the people pitied him, because he seemed as
one whose head was filled with ghostly things; and
they fed him.</p>

<p>Further and further into the waste places he
pushed, making the empty spaces sweet and sad with
his singing; and the winter came. Thin and lean he
grew, and his pony grew lean and thin.</p>

<p>And the white, mad spirits of the snow beat about
the two. And now and then snow ghosts writhed up
out of the ground and twisted and twirled and
moaned, until they took on the shape of her he
sought. And ever he followed them; and ever they
fell back into the ground. And the world was bitter
cold.</p>

<p><i>Wahoo!</i> the snow ghosts that we follow, O White
Brother!</p>

<p>And the time came when the pony was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a pony, but a quiet heap of bones; and upon this
sat the man who walked for the moon. Then did
the strength go out of him, and he turned his sharp
face to the South. He sang no more for many
days, for his body was as a lodge in which a fair
woman lies dead with no mourners around. And at
last he wakened in a strange lodge in a village of
strangers.</p>

<p class="p2">And it happened when the green things pushed
upward into the sun again that a young man who
seemed very old, for he was bent, his face was thin,
his eyes were very big, hobbled back into the village
of his people.</p>

<p>And he went to a lodge which was empty, for the
father with his frowning and the mother with her
weeping had taken the long trail, upon which comes
no moon and never the sun rises&mdash;but the stars are
there.</p>

<p>Many days he lay within the lonesome lodge.
And it happened that a maiden, one whom he had
pushed aside in other days, came into the lodge with
meat and water.</p>

<p>So at last he said: “I have sought and have not
found; therefore will I be as other men. I will fill
this lodge with a woman&mdash;and this is she. Henceforth
I shall forget the dream that led me; I shall
be a hunter of bison and a killer of enemies; for after
all, what else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>And this he did.</p>

<p>So all the village buzzed with kindly words.
“The fool has come back wise!” they said.</p>

<p>And as the seasons passed there grew the laughter
of <i>zhinga zhingas</i> in the lodge of the man who
walked no more for the moon.</p>

<p>But a sadness was upon his face. And after a
while the dream came back and brought the singing.
Less and less he looked upon the woman and the
children. Less and less he sought the bison, until at
last Hunger came into that lodge and sat beside the
fire.</p>

<p>Then again the old cry of the people grew up:
“The fool still lives! He sings while his lodge is
empty. His woman has become a stranger to him,
and his children are as though a stranger had
fathered them! Shall the fool eat and only sing?”</p>

<p>And a snarling cry grew up: “Cast out the
fool!”</p>

<p>And it was done.</p>

<p>So out of the village stumbled the singing fool,
and his head was bloody with the stones the people
threw. Very old he seemed, though his years were
not many. Into the North he went, and men saw
his face no more.</p>

<p>But lo! many seasons passed and yet he lived and
was among all peoples! For often on hot dusty
trails weary men sat down to sing his songs; and
women, weeping over fallen braves, found his songs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
upon their lips. And when the hunger came his
strange wild cries went among the people. And all
were comforted!</p>

<p>And this, O White Brother, is the story of the
fool who walked for the moon!</p>

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WHITE WAKUNDA</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">HE was the son of Sky-Walker’s oldest squaw
and he was born in the time when the lone
goose flies (February). It was a very bitter
winter, so that many years after the old men spoke of
it as “the winter of the big snows.”</p>

<p>Sky-Walker, his father, was a seer of great visions,
and he had a power that was more than the power of
strong arms. He was a thunder man, and he could
make rain.</p>

<p>And when Sky-Walker’s oldest squaw bore a son
there was much wonder in the village, for she was
far past her summer and the frost had already fallen
on her hair. Also, she was lean and wrinkled.</p>

<p>So the old men and women came to the lodge of
Sky-Walker and looked upon the newborn child.
They looked and they shook their heads, for the
child was not as a child should be. He was no
bigger than a baby coyote littered in a terrible winter
after a summer of famine. He was not fat.</p>

<p>“He can never be a <i>waschuscha</i> [brave],” said
one old man; “I have seen many <i>zhinga zhingas</i>
[babies] who grew strong, but they were not like
this one. He will carry wood and water.”</p>

<p>And Sky-Walker’s old squaw arose from the blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
where she lay with the child, and sat up, fixing
eyes of bitterness upon those who came to pity, and
she said:</p>

<p>“He will be more than a killer of men or a hunter
of bison. Wakunda sent him to me, for I am old
and past my time. See, I am lean and wrinkled, and
it is already winter in my hair. Also I had visions.
Let my man tell you; he knows.”</p>

<p>And Sky-Walker, sitting beside the old mother,
gave words to the old men and women, who knew
his little words to be bigger than the big words of
most men.</p>

<p>“The woman speaks true. She is past her time,
and she has seen things that made me wonder, and I
am wise. She had visions, but in them there was no
singing of arrows, nor drumming of pony hoofs, nor
dancing of braves in war paint, nor cries of conquered
enemies; neither was there any thunder or
lightning.</p>

<p>“There was only the soft speaking of quiet things&mdash;the
sound of the growing of green things under
the sun. And before the last moon died, once she
wakened me from my sleeping, for she had had a
dream. She saw her son walking a mighty man
among the tribes, yet he had no weapons.</p>

<p>“And a great light, greater than sunlight, was
about him. This she told me. Many times have we
seen together the drifting of the snows, and always
her words were true words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“And see, it is a boy, even as she dreamed. Also
he has come in the time when the lone goose flies. I
see much in this. He shall be alone, but high in
loneliness, and he shall go far, far! Look where
he gazes upon you with man-eyes! Are they the
eyes of a <i>zhinga zhinga</i>?”</p>

<p>The old folks looked and pitied no more, for the
eyes were not as other eyes. They had a strange
light, making the old ones wonder.</p>

<p>So the word passed around and around the circle
of lodges that Sky-Walker’s oldest squaw had a son
who was not a common <i>zhinga zhinga</i>. And as the
talk grew, the name of the child grew with it. So
he was called Wa-choo-bay, “the Holy One.”</p>

<p>And as Wa-choo-bay grew, so grew the wonder
of the people, for he never cried, and he talked
soon. Also from the first he appeared as one over
whom many winters had passed.</p>

<p>When he reached that age when he should have
played with the other boys, he did not play, but was
much alone upon the prairie without the village.
He never took part in the game of Pawnee <i>zhay-day</i>,
the game of spear and hoop, which made the other
boys laugh and shout.</p>

<p>One evening in his fifth year, his father, Sky-Walker,
said to him:</p>

<p>“It is the time for the coming of the dreams to
Wa-choo-bay. Let him go afar into a lonesome
place without food and lift his hands and his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to Wakunda. Four sleeps let him stay in the lonesome
place, that his dream may come.”</p>

<p>So his mother smeared his forehead with mud and
muttered to the spirits:</p>

<p>“Thus shall you know Wa-choo-bay, who goes
forth to have his first dream. Send him a good
dream.”</p>

<p>And Wa-choo-bay went forth into a lonesome
place without food.</p>

<p>And on the morning of the fifth day, when the
squaws were making fires, he returned, and as he
entered the village and went to the lodge of his
father the squaws gazed upon his face, seeing that
which was very strange.</p>

<p>They wakened the sleepers in the lodges, saying:</p>

<p>“Wa-choo-bay is come back with a strange medicine-look
upon his face! He has had a great dream;
come and see.”</p>

<p>And the village awoke and crowded about the
lodge of Sky-Walker, who came forth and said:</p>

<p>“Go away! Something great has happened to
my <i>nu-zhinga</i> [boy], and he is about to tell me his
dream.”</p>

<p>And the people went away, awed and silent.</p>

<p>In the stillness of his lodge Sky-Walker gazed
upon the boy’s face and said:</p>

<p>“What has Wa-choo-bay seen?”</p>

<p>And Wa-choo-bay said:</p>

<p>“I went far into a lonesome place; there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
nothing but the crows and the prairie and the sky.
I lifted my hands and my voice as you told me. I
said the words you told me. Then I slept, and when
I awoke this is what I remembered; the rest was like
big things moving in the mist.</p>

<p>“I was on the shore of the Ne Shoda [Missouri],
and a little canoe came up to me, and I got in, for a
voice told me to get in. Then the canoe swam out
into the water and went fast. I went toward the
place of summer. I rode far, many sleeps, and then
as I was about to come to the end of my long riding,
I awoke. Four times I saw this, and then I came
here. What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Sky-Walker. “I must
think hard, and then maybe I will know.”</p>

<p>And Sky-Walker shut himself in his lodge and
thought hard for four sleeps. And when the fifth
morning came he said to Wa-choo-bay:</p>

<p>“I have thought hard, and now I know that it is
the big things moving in the mist that you must see.
Go forth and dream again in the lonesome place.”</p>

<p>And so Wa-choo-bay went forth with the mud on
his brow, crying to the spirits that he might see the
big things that moved in the mist. He slept and
dreamed. Again he was in the canoe and he rode
far.</p>

<p>Then at last the river tossed him upon the sand,
and lo! there was a big, big village before him, and
the lodges of it were strange and very big. Then
the big village wavered like the picture of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in a pool that is disturbed, and vanished. And the
sun was on the hills.</p>

<p>So Wa-choo-bay went back to his father and told
him what he had seen, and Sky-Walker said:</p>

<p>“This is very strange. After many sunlights of
flowing, the big muddy water comes to a place where
a big new tribe has its lodges. And the faces of
the tribe are white. Something it is about this tribe
that you have dreamed. And I am afraid, for
Wakunda meant that all faces should be of the
colour of the earth. Let the sunlight pass, and then
we shall know the meaning of this dream.”</p>

<p>The days grew into years, and Wa-choo-bay sat
at the feet of the old men, learning much.</p>

<p>He learned the names of the thunder spirits that
are never spoken aloud. He learned the songs that
the thunder spirits love. He learned to call the rain.
He learned the manner of the rite of <i>Wazhinadee</i>,
by which one may kill a man without the use of
weapons. And when he had grown to be a tall
youth, he was taken into the sacred lodge where the
holy relics are kept. For it seemed plain that
Wakunda meant him for a great medicine-man.</p>

<p>But it was in the summer when he had reached the
height of a man that Wa-choo-bay did that which
marked him for the lonesome way.</p>

<p>It happened that the summer had been one of
peace and plenty; so the Omahas called in the Pawnees
and the Poncas for a powwow, which is a great
feast and a talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>And the two neighbouring tribes had taken the
peace trail and come to the Omaha village. Then
there was much painting in the colours of peace, and
the village that the three tribes made was more than
one could see with a look.</p>

<p>In a great circle it lay in the flat lands of Ne
Shoda, with an opening to the place of morning.
And in the centre there was built a large semicircular
shade of willow boughs, in which the braves
would dance and sing, giving away presents of
ponies, furs, hides, and trinkets that please the eye.</p>

<p>One day there was a great dancing and a great
giving away. Many ponies had been led into the
sunny centre of the semicircular shade, and given
away to those whom the criers called.</p>

<p>And Wa-choo-bay was there, standing tall and
thin, alone amid all the revellers, for more and more
as the sunlights passed he thought deep thoughts.</p>

<p>Among the Poncas sat a young squaw who was
good to see, for she was slender and taller than a
common brave. And upon her forehead was the
tattooed sunspot that marked her for the daughter
of the owner of many ponies. She was called Umba
(Sunlight), and she was the best to see of all the
daughters of the assembled tribes.</p>

<p>To-day she sat amid the revelling and saw none of
it. She saw only the tall youth, standing alone like a
beech tree among a cluster of scrub oaks. And her
eyes grew soft as she looked.</p>

<p>And when the centre of the place of shade had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
cleared, she arose and walked into the centre. There
she stood, a stately figure, with soft eyes fixed upon
Wa-choo-bay.</p>

<p>At length she raised her arms toward him and
sang a low, droning song, like that a mother sings
to her child in the evening when the fires burn
blue.</p>

<p>And all the people listened, breathless, for she was
fair, and the song, which was a song of love, was
sung to Wa-choo-bay alone, standing thin and tall
and deep in thought.</p>

<p>Then when her song had ceased, she took off her
blanket of dyed buckskin, and, holding it at arm’s
length toward Wa-choo-bay, she said:</p>

<p>“I give my blanket to the tall and lonesome one.
Let him come and take it, and I shall follow him on
all his trails, even if they be hard trails that lead to
death!”</p>

<p>And Wa-choo-bay raised his eyes and gazed with
a sad look upon the Ponca woman. His voice came
strong, but soft:</p>

<p>“I cannot take the blanket; neither shall I ever
take a squaw. For I am a dreamer of dreams. I
shall never hear <i>zhinga zhingas</i> laughing about my
lodge. I am going on a long trail, for I follow a
dream. Yet have I never seen a woman so good to
see. There is an ache in my breast as I speak. Let
this woman follow one who kills enemies and hunts
bison. I dream dreams, and a long trail is before
me, and its end is in the mist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Umba moaned and walked out of the circle
with her head bowed.</p>

<p>And Sky-Walker, seeing this, said:</p>

<p>“It is even as I said. He was born in the time
of the lone goose. He shall be alone, but high in
loneliness; and he shall go far, far.”</p>

<p>And the time came when the tribes took the homeward
trail. Then one day Wa-choo-bay raised his
voice among the people and said:</p>

<p>“My time is come to go. I take a long, lonesome
trail, for a dream dreamed many times is leading
me.”</p>

<p>Then he went down to the great river where a
canoe lay, and the people followed.</p>

<p>They said no word as he pushed the canoe into
the current and shot downstream, for a white light
was upon his face, and the dream rode with him.</p>

<p>Then Sky-Walker and his old squaw climbed a
high bluff and watched the speck that was Wa-choo-bay
fading in the mist of distance.</p>

<p>“This is the last I shall see,” said the old woman,
“for I am old and the winter is in my hair. But
great things will happen when I am gone.”</p>

<p>And under the shade of a lean hand raised browward
she saw the black speck vanish in the blue of
distance.</p>

<p class="p2">Summers and winters passed. Sky-Walker and
his old squaw died; the name of Wa-choo-bay became
a dim and mystic thing. Yet often about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fires of winter, when the wind moaned about the
lodges, the old men talked of the going away of the
Holy One, making the eyes of the youths grow big
with wonder.</p>

<p>And often the old men and women gazed from
the high bluff down the dim stretches of the muddy
river, wondering when Wa-choo-bay would come
back, for it was said that great things would happen
at his coming.</p>

<p>It happened many years after the going away of
Wa-choo-bay that the Omaha tribe had its village
in the valley on a creek near the big muddy water.</p>

<p>It was the time when the sunflowers made sunlight
in the valleys and when the women were busy
pulling weeds from the gardens.</p>

<p>One evening a band of youths, who had been playing
on the bluffs overlooking the far reaches of the
river, came with breathless speed and terror-stricken
faces into the village.</p>

<p>“<i>Monda geeung</i> [devil boat]!” they cried,
pointing to the river. “A big canoe breathing out
smoke and fire is swimming up Ne Shoda.”</p>

<p>The whole village scrambled up the bluffs, and
what they saw was not forgotten for many moons.
It was a boat, but it was not as other boats. It
breathed smoke and fire. It grunted and puffed like
a swimmer in a heavy current.</p>

<p>It had a great arm that reached before it. Also
it had two noses, where the smoke and fire came
out. It had eyes along its side that sparkled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
evening sunlight. There was none to paddle it, yet
it moved steadily against the current.</p>

<p>The people stood bunched closely together and
shivering with fear as the monster approached. With
a chugging and a swishing and a coughing, it swam,
turning its head towards the bluff where the people
watched and reaching out its one big arm toward
them.</p>

<p>“It sees us! It wishes to eat us!” cried the
people, and like a herd of frightened bison they ran
and tumbled down the bluff. They hid in their
lodges with their weapons grasped in their hands.
They made no noise, lest the monster should find
them.</p>

<p>But the devil-swimmer did not come. The people
listened. At length the sound of the mighty breathing
stopped, then it began again and grew dimmer
and dimmer until it died away far up the stream.</p>

<p>And when the people came forth cautiously from
their hiding, a man, tall, thin, with a strange look
upon his bronze face, stood in the centre of the
village.</p>

<p>Awed by the mien of the stranger, the people
stared in silence. The sun had fallen and the
shadows of the evening were about him. Also he
wore garments that were not as Wakunda meant
garments should be.</p>

<p>The stranger cast a long gaze about him, then
raised his arms and said in a voice that was strong
but soft:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“I breathe peace upon my people.”</p>

<p>The words were Omaha words, yet they sounded
strange.</p>

<p>Again the voice was raised in the shadows and
passed like a wind among the people, shaking them.</p>

<p>“I am Wa-choo-bay&mdash;he who followed the long
dream-trail&mdash;and I am come back with a great
wisdom for the tribes.”</p>

<p>But the people only trembled, and the old men
whispered:</p>

<p>“It is not Wa-choo-bay, but his spirit. Well is
the face remembered, but the words are not man-words.”</p>

<p>Then the stranger passed about the circle of the
wondering people, touching them as he went, for he
had heard the whispering of the old men. And the
people shrank from him.</p>

<p>“I am Wa-choo-bay,” cried the stranger again.
“I am the son of Sky-Walker. I am a man, and
not a spirit. Give me meat, for I am hungry.”</p>

<p>And they gave him meat, and he ate. Then only
did the people know him for a man.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Wa-choo-bay told
many strange things of the white-faced race whose
camp fires were kindled ever nearer and nearer the
people of the prairie. Also he said words that were
not common words. They were medicine-words.</p>

<p>And before many moons had grown and died
these things travelled far and wide across the prairie,
until in many tribes the wonder grew. Around many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
camp fires was told the tale of how an Omaha had
come back after being many years in the lands that
lay toward the place of summer; also of the devil-boat
in which he came, and of the new wisdom he
was talking.</p>

<p>So there was a great moving of the tribes toward
the village of the Omahas. The Poncas, the Pawnees,
the Osages, the Missouris, the Otoes&mdash;all
heard the strange tale and took the trail that led to
the village lying in the flat lands of Ne Shoda.</p>

<p>And in the time when the prairie was brown there
was a great gathering of the prairie peoples in the
flat lands.</p>

<p>The cluster of villages that they made was so
broad that a strong man walked from morning until
the sun was high before he reached the other side.
Then one morning when the tribes had gathered
Wa-choo-bay went to the top of a bluff that stood
bleak against the sky, and the people followed, sitting
below him upon the hillside, for they wished to hear
the strange words that would be spoken that day.</p>

<p>Wa-choo-bay, standing thin and tall against the
sky, raised his arms and his face to the heavens,
breathing strange words above the people, upon
whom a great hush fell.</p>

<p>And it happened that in the hush a tamed wolf
among the people near the summit of the bluff raised
its snout and mourned into the sudden stillness.</p>

<p>And its master beat it for the noise it made until
it cried with pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Wa-choo-bay
walked in among the gazers and laid caressing hands
upon the wolf, calling it by gentle names until it
licked his hands.</p>

<p>And when he returned to the summit, the wolf followed,
licking the feet of Wa-choo-bay as it went.</p>

<p>Then Wa-choo-bay raised his voice, and it went
even to the farthest listener, though it seemed a soft
voice.</p>

<p>“This is the first I shall teach you: be kind to
everything that lives.”</p>

<p>And the people wondered much. This was a new
teaching.</p>

<p>In the hush of awe that fell, Wa-choo-bay spoke
again, while the wolf sat by him, licking his feet.
He told of his being in the lands that lay toward the
summer; of the great white-faced race that lived
there; of the great villages that they built, having
lodges bigger than half a prairie village.</p>

<p>He told of the strength of this great white-faced
race; of how they were moving steadily toward the
people of the prairie. And then he told in quaint
phrases the story of Christ and His teachings of
kindness.</p>

<p>“These things I learned from the great medicine-men
of the white-faced race, and they are wise men,”
said Wa-choo-bay. “It is this that has made their
people great. So I have come to say: Have
no more fighting on the prairie; be one great tribe,
even like the white-faces; build great villages like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
them, for I have learned that only they who build
great villages and do not wander shall live. The
others must flee like the bison when hunters follow.</p>

<p>“And I will teach you the wise words of the great
white Wakunda’s Son, who died because he loved
all the tribes. It is a teaching of peace&mdash;a teaching
that we be kind to our enemies.”</p>

<p>Then there arose one among the Osages, an old
man, and he said:</p>

<p>“These are big words. Let Wa-choo-bay call
down rain upon us if this big white God loves him.”</p>

<p>Then arose one among the Pawnees, and he cried
in broken Omaha:</p>

<p>“I say with my Osage brother, let Wa-choo-bay
do some medicine-deed, that we may know him for
a holy one.”</p>

<p>And still another among the Poncas arose and
said:</p>

<p>“If this be true that we have heard, how Wa-choo-bay
came back in a holy boat, and that his big
white Wakunda is so strong and loves Wa-choo-bay,
let him send the rain, and we will fall upon our
faces.”</p>

<p>Then the whole concourse of tribes sent up a
shout:</p>

<p>“Give us some medicine-deed!”</p>

<p>And when the shout had died, Wa-choo-bay smiled
a smile of pity and said:</p>

<p>“I am not the big white Wakunda; I am only
one who talks for Him and loves Him, for I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
seen a new light. I can do no medicine-deeds.
Neither can anyone among you do medicine-deeds.
It is all a dreaming&mdash;and we must awaken.”</p>

<p>Then there was a great crying, an angry storm of
voices about the hill. It beat upon the bleak summit
where Wa-choo-bay stood with face and hands raised
to the heavens, breathing a prayer of the white-faces.</p>

<p>There was a breaking up of the concourse and a
walking away. But one among the people hurled a
stone with sure aim and struck Wa-choo-bay upon
the side of the face. He staggered, and the blood
came. But he showed no anger.</p>

<p>Turning the other side of his face, he said:</p>

<p>“Let him who threw the stone throw again and
strike me here. Even so the great white Wakunda’s
Son suffered.”</p>

<p>But the second stone was not cast, and Wa-choo-bay
was left alone with the wolf upon the summit,
kneeling and muttering words of kindness.</p>

<p>The day passed, and still he knelt upon the summit.
But when the dark had fallen, he became
aware of someone near him. He raised his head
and saw in the starlight a woman lying upon her
face before him, and she was moaning.</p>

<p>Wa-choo-bay lifted her and looked into her face.
It was a face that he had known of old, only the
winters had changed it.</p>

<p>“I am Umba, the Ponca woman,” she said.
“Many summers ago I spoke to you. Do you remember?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>And Wa-choo-bay said: “I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p>Then said Umba, the Ponca woman: “Even now
it is the same as then. I have come to take the hard
trail with you, even the trail that leads to death, for
in all these winters and summers I have taken no
man.”</p>

<p>And she wiped the blood from his face with her
blanket of buckskin.</p>

<p>There was an aching in the breast of Wa-choo-bay
as he said these words, which the Ponca woman
could not understand, though her tongue was one
with his:</p>

<p>“From now through all the summers and winters
that follow, your name shall be Mary.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard my words?” he said after a
long silence.</p>

<p>“I have heard,” said the woman, “and I believe.
I alone among all the villagers believe.”</p>

<p>“Then shall you follow me on my lonesome trail.
I see not its end, for it is in the mist.”</p>

<p class="p2">The days when the prairie was brown passed, and
the snows came. And there was one who followed a
bitter winter trail.</p>

<p>From village to village he went, speaking words
of kindness and doing good deeds. But everywhere
he was driven from the villages. And there were
two who followed him&mdash;two faithful disciples&mdash;the
woman, whose name was changed to Mary, and the
wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>And ever the tall thin man, whose face was
pinched with hunger and the cold, gave kind words
to those who offered blows.</p>

<p>It happened in the time of <i>Hunga-Mubli</i>&mdash;the
time when the snows drift against the north sides of
the lodges, that a rumour ran across the prairie&mdash;a
rumour that a strange sickness had come to the village
of the Poncas. It was the sickness called <i>Gchatunga</i>,
the sickness of the big, red sores.</p>

<p>Then Wa-choo-bay and his two disciples turned
weary feet toward the stricken village of the Poncas.
It was a hard trail, with little food and much cold.</p>

<p>And when the three entered the stricken village
there was a rejoicing among the Poncas, for they
said:</p>

<p>“Might it not be that this one whom we have
spurned is stronger than we thought?”</p>

<p>But Wa-choo-bay sang no medicine-songs; he performed
no mystic rites. With tender hands he
nursed the sick. Also he knelt beside them and said
soft words that were not the words of the prairie.</p>

<p>And it happened that the invisible arrows of the
Terror fell thicker and thicker among the Poncas.
The sickness spread, and the village was filled with
the delirious shrieks of the dying.</p>

<p>So a great, angry wail went up against Wa-choo-bay.</p>

<p>“The sickness grows greater, not less,” said those
who were still strong. “This Wa-choo-bay’s words
are not true words. There is a black spirit in him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>So it happened that arms that were still strong
seized Wa-choo-bay and bound him with thongs of
buckskin. Then he was led afar from the village to
the bleak, cold summit of a hill.</p>

<p>There they planted a post and bound Wa-choo-bay
to it.</p>

<p>And the woman, whose name was changed to
Mary, begged for him, and the wolf, with its four
feet huddled together in the snow, mourned with
an upward thrusting of the snout.</p>

<p>But Wa-choo-bay said:</p>

<p>“Do not wail for me. This is the place where my
trail ends. This is what was in the mist. Let these
whom I love do as they will do.”</p>

<p>And when they had bound him to the post they
whipped him with elkhorn whips.</p>

<p>“Where is your white Wakunda?” they cried,
and it was a hate cry.</p>

<p>“Here beside us stands the white Wakunda and
His Son!” said Wa-choo-bay; and his brow was wet
with the sweat of agony. But the whippers did not
see, and the whips fell harder.</p>

<p>And after some time Wa-choo-bay raised his head
weakly to the darkening heavens, for the sun had
fallen, and moaned soft words that were not prairie
words.</p>

<p>Then his head fell forward upon his breast.</p>

<p>The whips fell no more. The whippers departed.</p>

<p>The sky was like a sheet of frosty metal and the
stars were like broken ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Against the sky hung the thin figure of Wa-choo-bay
lashed to the post, and beneath him in the
shadow huddled two who sent trembling cries of
sorrow into the empty spaces of the snow&mdash;a woman
and a wolf.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TRIUMPH OF SEHA</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN Seha had grown to be a tall youth,
he said to the old men: “Now I am
almost a man; what shall I do?” For
being a youth, he dreamed of great things. And the
old men answered: “That Wakunda knows; therefore,
take yourself to a high hill; there fast and pray
until sleep comes, and with it a vision.”</p>

<p>So Seha arose and laid aside his garments, and
naked, went out on the prairie. When he had
gone far, he climbed to the top of a lonely hill, bare
of grass and strewn with flakes of stone that made
its summit white like the head of a man who has seen
many winters.</p>

<p>Then he knelt upon the flinty summit, and raising
his palms to the heavens, he cried: “O Wakunda,
here needy stands Seha!” Four times he uttered
the cry, yet there was no sound save that of the crow
overhead, and the wind in the short grass of the hillside.</p>

<p>Then he fell into an agony of weeping, and wetting
his palms with his tears, he rubbed them in the
white dust and smeared his face with mud. Then he
cast his wet eyes to the heavens, and again raised his
hands in supplication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Wakunda, Seha is a young man; he would
do great things like the old men; send him a vision!”</p>

<p>The night came down and still he held his eyes
upon the darkening heavens, crying for a vision.
But only the coyote answered him. The stars looked
out of the east and steadily climbed upward, gazing
upon his tearful face. But when the grey of age
began to grow upon the forehead of the Night, he
grew so weary that he fell forward upon his face
and slept.</p>

<p>And lo! the vision came!</p>

<p>It seemed that the skies were black and fierce as
the face of a brave in anger. The lightning glared;
and the thunder shouted like a warrior in the front
of the battle! Then the cloud split, and through it
rushed a mighty eagle with the lightning playing on
its wings; its cry was like the shriek of a dying foe
and its eyes were bright with the vision that sees far.
Its wings hovered over Seha, and it spoke:</p>

<p>“Seha shall be a seer of things far off. His
thought shall be quick as the lightning, and his voice
shall be as thunder in the ears of men!”</p>

<p>Seha awoke, and he was shivering with the dews
of morning. Then he arose and walked back toward
his village, slowly, for his thoughts were great.
Four days he went about the village, speaking to no
one; and the people whispered: “Seha has had a
vision; do you not see that his eyes are big with a
strange light?”</p>

<p>One night after the four days had passed, Seha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
arose from his blankets and, creeping stealthily out
of his tepee, he went to the lodge of Ebahamba, who
was a great medicine-man, for Seha wished to tell
his vision into a wise ear.</p>

<p>Pulling back the buffalo robe that hung across the
entrance he saw the great man sleeping in the moonlight
that fell through the opening at the top of the
tepee. Entering, he touched the shoulder of the
sleeper, who awoke with a start, and, sitting up,
stared at the young intruder. Then Ebahamba
being thoroughly awakened, spoke:</p>

<p>“Seha has come to tell his vision; I knew he
would come; speak.”</p>

<p>“You are a great man,” began Seha, “and your
eyes are like the sun’s eyes to see into the shadow.
Hear me and teach me.”</p>

<p>Then he told of his vision on the lonely hill.</p>

<p>As Ebahamba listened to the wonderful thing that
had befallen the youth, his heart grew cold with
envy; for certainly great things were in store for
Seha, and might it not come to pass that the youth
should grow even greater in power than Ebahamba
himself?</p>

<p>So, when the youth had ceased, breathless with
the wonder of the thing he told, the old man said
coldly: “Wakunda will teach Seha; let him go
learn of the wind and the growing things!”</p>

<p>Then the youth arose and left the lodge. But the
big medicine-man slept no more that night, for jealousy
is sleepless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>At that time it happened that the winds were hot
from the southwest, and the maize grew yellow as
the sun that smote it, and the rainless air curled its
blades. And the old man Ebahamba cried to Wakunda
for rain; but the skies only glared back for
answer.</p>

<p>Then a great moan went up before the lodge of
the big medicine-man, Ebahamba. “Ebahamba
speaks with the spirits; let him pray to the thunder
spirits that we may have food for our squaws and
our children!”</p>

<p>And Ebahamba shut himself in his tepee four
days, fasting, crying to the thunder spirits, and performing
strange rites. But every morning the sun
arose glaring like the eye of a man who dies of fever,
and the hot wind sweltered up from the southwest,
moaning hoarsely like one who moans with thirst;
and the maize heard the moan and wilted.</p>

<p>Then when the people grew clamorous before the
lodge of Ebahamba, he came forth and said: “The
thunder spirits are sleeping; they are weary and
drowsy with the heat.” And the hooting of his
people drove him back into his lodge.</p>

<p>Then Seha raised his voice above the despairing
murmur of the village, saying: “Seha is a young
man, yet the thunder spirits will hear him, be they
ever so drowsy, for Seha has had a vision. Seha will
call the rain.”</p>

<p>The murmur of the people ceased, for so strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a light was in the eyes of the youth that they believed.</p>

<p>“Let Seha give us rain,” they cried, “and he shall
be a great man among his people!”</p>

<p>Then Seha strode out of the village and disappeared
in the hills. His heart was loud as he walked,
for would he not be a great man among his people?
He believed in his power with that belief which is
the power. All day he walked, and when the red
sun glared across the western hills like an eye bloodshot
with pain, he came to a clump of cottonwoods
that sang upon the summit of a bluff.</p>

<p>Now the thunder spirits love the cottonwoods, for
they rise sternly from the earth, reaching their long
arms into the clouds, and they cry back at the storm
with a loud voice. Where the cottonwood sings,
there the thunder spirits sleep, and the thunder
birds, the eagle and the hawk, watch with keen
eyes.</p>

<p>Under the trees Seha stood, and raising his hands
and his eyes to the heavens, he cried: “Hear Seha!
For is he not a thunder man? Did he not dream the
thunder man’s dream? Then I command you, send
the big clouds boiling before the wind; send the
rains, that my people may have food for their children.
Then I will be a great man among my
people!”</p>

<p>The trees only tossed their branches above him,
while they sang softly in the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Thunder Spirits!” he cried again. “You are
not asleep! I hear you talking together in the tree
tops. Listen to me, for I am a thunder man!”</p>

<p>Then a dead calm grew. The cottonwoods were
still. Suddenly they groaned with a cool gust from
the east. The groan was like a waking man’s groan
when he arises, stretching and yawning, from his
blankets.</p>

<p>Then Seha lay down to sleep; for were not the
thunder spirits awake?</p>

<p>When the night was late, Seha was awakened by
the howl of the thunder. He saw the quick lightning
pierce the boiling darkness in the east. Then
the rain drops danced upon the dry hills with a sound
like the unintelligible patter of many voices that are
glad.</p>

<p>Seha was glad, and he answered the shout of the
thunder. His people in the village were glad, and
their tongues were noisy with the name of Seha.
The maize was glad and it looked up to the kind
sky, tossing its arms in exultation.</p>

<p>When Seha returned to the village, he was the
centre of a joyful cry; he had become a great man
among his people. And when they asked from
whence he had such great powers, he said: “I
caught it from the blowing wind; I heard it in the
growing of the maize.”</p>

<p>But there was one who did not greet the mysterious
youth. Ebahamba shut himself in his tepee,
for had he not failed to awaken the thunder spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
when a youth had succeeded? Ebahamba sat sullenly
in his tepee, thinking great and fierce thoughts;
and after many days of fasting, his magic came back
to him. Then he summoned to his lodge one by one,
the men of his band, and he said to each: “Behold!
Seha speaks with evil spirits. May he not destroy
his people? Then let us perform the rite of <i>Wazhinadee</i>
against him that he may be forsaken by man
and beast and so die!”</p>

<p>The men of his band believed Ebahamba, for his
magic was very great now, and he forced them to
believe. So each man went to his tepee, shut himself
in, feasted and thought sternly against Seha. For
this is the manner of the rite of <i>Wazhinadee</i>.</p>

<p>Then after his enemies had thought strongly for
many days against him, Seha was seized with a
strange weakness. His eyes lost their brightness,
and he could not see far as before. All through the
days and the nights he went about the village, crying
for his lost power; and the people said: “The coyotes
are barking in the hills.” They could not see
him for the mist that the terrible rite had cast about
him.</p>

<p>Then Seha wandered out on the prairie, wailing
as ever for his lost power. And after many days,
he laid himself down by a stream to die. But he did
not die. He slept; and the vision came again. When
he awoke, he was strong again and his eyes could see
far as before.</p>

<p>Then he said: “I will cleanse myself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
stream and go back to my people, for I am strong
again.”</p>

<p>But lo! as he leaned over the clear stream, he beheld
the reflected image of an eagle far above him.
Now a medicine man can change himself at will into
anything that walks or crawls or flies or is still; and
as Seha watched the eagle, he knew that it was
Ebahamba!</p>

<p>So gliding into the stream, he quickly changed
himself into a great fish floundering temptingly upon
the surface. The eagle, which was Ebahamba, being
hungry, swooped down upon the fish with wide beak
and open talons.</p>

<p>In a moment, Seha changed himself into a huge
boulder, against which the swooping bird dashed
furiously, crushing its beak and talons. Then it
arose, and with bloody wings, fluttered across the
prairie.</p>

<p>Seha stepped out of his rock and laughed a loud,
long laugh, and the eagle, which was Ebahamba,
heard and knew.</p>

<p>So Seha returned to his village and was a great
man among his people. But Ebahamba hid himself
in his tepee; and a rumour ran that his arms were
broken and his face crushed.</p>

<p>And there was much wonder in the village!</p>

<p class="pch">THE END OF THE DREAM</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE old woman Gunthai had nothing but a
past over which she brooded and a son
upon whom she doted. Had she been able
to write the latter in the letters of that tongue which
came to the prairie many moons after her death,
breaking with syllables of magic the spell of the
centuries, she would have written it with a “u”;
for her son was as the day to her; his coming was
the morning and his going was the sunset. When
he laughed, there was summer in the wretched little
tepee; when he cried, the snows drifted about the
mother-heart.</p>

<p>Winter and summer the old woman sat in her
lodge, her back bent with the burdens of many seasons
and her face seamed with many memories; yet
stern and expressionless as of one who has followed
a long trail and cannot see its end though the sun
be falling.</p>

<p>All day she would sit in her lodge, weaving baskets
of willow, which she exchanged with her tribesmen
for meat and robes; for the father of her child
was dead. Her little boy, whom she tenderly called
Nu Zhinga (Little Man), would lie long hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
before her with his chin resting upon his little brown
hands, watching the fingers of his mother weave the
pliant twigs into form with marvellous skill, as it
seemed to him; and often when the hours crept
lamely, he would sing to her a monotonous song like
the wind’s, timing the irregular air with the beating
of his toes upon the floor.</p>

<p>And when the little singer would cease, the old
woman Gunthai often forgot the unwoven basket
with gazing into his big black eyes, for in them her
hope could read great deeds that were to be done
after many unborn moons had waned.</p>

<p>Then she would tell him tales of his father; tales
that were loud with the snarl of war drums, the
twang of bow thongs, the shriek of arrows, the beat
of hoofs! But there was no responsive glitter in the
eyes of the boy; his heart was not the warrior’s, and
the old mother seeing this, sighed and fell to work
with nervous haste.</p>

<p>And the days of sun and snow wove themselves
into years, until Nu Zhinga had reached that time
when boyhood begins to deepen into manhood; and
yet as the mother looked upon her son, she found
him scarcely taller than a weak man’s bow.</p>

<p>His legs were short and bowed, his hips narrow,
and upon shoulders of abnormal breadth sat his
monstrous, shaggy head. It was as if he were the
visible body of a black spirit’s joke, save for his
lustrous eyes, that were like two stars that burn big
in the air of evening through a film of mist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus it was that when Nu Zhinga passed
through the village, those who were still foolish
with youth jeered at the lad, calling his name in contempt;
but the old men and women who had grown
wise, only shook their heads and pitied Gunthai in
silence.</p>

<p>But the boy would take no notice of his tormentors,
walking on sullen and silent. He lived in a
little world of his own, which was isolated from the
great world by the unkindness of his people, like a
range of frozen hills; and in this small world there
were but three dwellers: Gunthai, a tame grey wolf,
and one other. That other was a despised little cripple
and her name was Tabea (Frog).</p>

<p>These three, and about them the chromatic glory
of dreams like a sunrise that lingers&mdash;this was the
world of Nu Zhinga. All day amid the quiet of
the summer hills Nu Zhinga and Tabea played together;
he telling of the great indefinite things that
he would do in that big mysterious sometime when
the days would be pregnant with wonders! For in
his soul the pulse of uncertain but lofty resolve
bounded, and as he peered into the future, lo! it was
vast, yet dim with misty possibilities like a broad
stretch of prairie expanding under the new moon!
And she, with all of her crooked little body attentive,
listened and believed even more than she heard;
which is the way of those who love.</p>

<p>And then these two, after the manner of children,
would play at life, building a tepee with willows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
from a convenient creek; and Tabea would groan
as she bore the heavy burdens, thus showing how she
would toil for him and suffer. Then when the tepee
was built, she would go about droning a song, with
her back bent as with the weight of an infant, thus
showing how she would carry the child of Nu
Zhinga in that big and sunlit sometime.</p>

<p>One day when the last white footstep of the winter
had vanished from the coldest valley, the old
woman Gunthai laid aside a finished basket and
called her boy to her side.</p>

<p>“It is the time,” she said; “the time is ripe with
summers. Nu Zhinga must eat no meat for four
days; then he must go to the hill where the visions
come, that he may know what is to be for him in
the light of the unborn moons.”</p>

<p>So Nu Zhinga ate no meat for four days, and
when the fourth evening came, as the fires roared
upward among the circled lodges, he passed through
the village and took his way to the high hill of
dreams. It was the time when the valleys are loud
with the song of frogs and when the Earth begins to
learn anew the pleasant lesson of the Sun.</p>

<p>When he had stopped, breathless with toiling up
the long incline, for he was weak with hunger, he
turned and looked back upon the jumbled village
and saw, indistinctly through the mist of the evening,
his mother standing before the door of her
lodge, straining her gaze that she might see her boy
for the last time, climbing to the height where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
dream awaited, that should send him back a man
with a future big in deeds.</p>

<p>Then Nu Zhinga climbed on to the summit of the
hill and watched the west pass from brilliant colours
into dun, and the darkness come with the stars. In
the light of a thin moon the far hills whitened. The
big stars glowed kindly like the camp fires of a
friendly people. The night wind talked to itself in
the gulches; and attentive to these, Nu Zhinga forgot
the reason of his coming, and lulled by the many
pleasant sounds, fell asleep and was awakened by
the pale damp Dawn.</p>

<p>Then he ran down the hill, and as he passed
through the village, the old women, some busy about
the steaming kettles, others bent beneath the loads of
fuel, shook their heads and said: “Gunthai’s boy
has had no vision; not so do they return who dream
great dreams.”</p>

<p>In the doorway of her lodge Gunthai stood awaiting
the approach of her son. Her body that was
wont to be bent like a bow upon which a heavy hand
is laid in anger, was erect and quivering as is the
bow when the arrow has sped like a purpose. Upon
her leathery, wrinkled face dwelt the glimmer of an
inner illumination. Only the flesh was old, the light
was young; for Hope is a youth.</p>

<p>As the lad approached, the tenseness of expectation
held the old woman’s tongue and her question
came from her eyes. “What has Nu Zhinga
dreamed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw the stars that were like the eyes of a
friend,” said the boy, “and I heard the wind as it
sang to itself in the gulches. I slept and woke and
the Sun was laughing on the hills!”</p>

<p>Many seasons sit lightly upon a form when Hope
sits with them; but Despair is heavy, and again the
weight of many years bent the shoulders of the
mother. When the sun leaves a cloud of glory, it
leaves a mass of murk; thus passed the light from
the wrinkled face of Gunthai.</p>

<p>There was a sigh in her voice as she spoke; a sigh
like that of a wind that is heavy with rain: “There
should have come a dream loud with the noises of
battle and shrill with the flight of arrows! Thus
did your father dream.”</p>

<p>So Nu Zhinga went a second and a third and a
fourth time to the hill of dreams, and the last answer
that his mother heard was like the first. And on
the fifth day the heart of the old mother was sore
with sorrow, and all that night she did not sleep, but
wept and moaned: “How shall Gunthai be comforted
when her eyes are dim and her fingers stiff?
Her son shall not be mighty in the hunt and battle,
for he has had no dream.”</p>

<p>The lad, awakened in the night by the moaning of
his mother, knew in an indefinite way that he was the
cause of so much grief; and in his breast grew a
great pang of soul hunger that would not pass away.
Even with the giant joy of the sunrise it did not
pass away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early light Nu Zhinga passed out of the village,
for his heart was heavy. As he walked, lo
everything was sad except the sun, and the light of
its gladness deepened the shadow of his sorrow.
The sound of the wind moving in the bunch grass of
the hillside was like a faint cry of a great pain. At
length he threw himself down and buried his face
in the grass. The despair of those who dream daydreams
was upon him. There was night in his heart;
his small body shook with sobs. A long while he
lay thus, nor did he hear the soft step that stopped
beside him.</p>

<p>At length Nu Zhinga raised his head from the
grass and saw Tabea sitting beside him with pity in
her eyes and in the attitude of her crooked little body.
Without a word they stared each into the face of
the other; and as Nu Zhinga looked, the desolate
grey of the world began to develop its wonted
brilliance of colour, as though the union of their
tears had produced a prism.</p>

<p>At length these two arose and walked among the
hills, dreaming as was their wont, and again the sunlight
entered the heart of Nu Zhinga. When the
two outcasts entered the village, even though the
youths trooped behind them shouting “Peazha!”
(no good), yet the sunlight did not pass; for upon
one hand walked the dreams of Nu Zhinga and upon
the other, Tabea.</p>

<p>One day in the time of the gathering of the maize,
when the brown hills shivered with the first frosts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the voice of a crier was heard through the village
calling the braves to battle; for the big chief of the
Omahas would lead a war party against the Sioux.</p>

<p>So the old woman Gunthai took down the weapons
of her fallen brave from the side of the tepee where
they had hung in idleness for many moons. She
strung the long unbent bow with a thong of buckskin
and retipped the arrows with the feathers of the
hawk. Then she wept over them, and blessed them
with weird songs; and calling Nu Zhinga to her side,
placed them in his hands, and said: “Bring them
back red with the blood of the Sioux!”</p>

<p>And the youth took them, wondering why it was
so very great a thing to kill.</p>

<p>Then the war party rode out of the village and
Nu Zhinga rode with it. And there were two who
climbed to the highest hill and, shading their eyes
with their hands, watched the braves disappear into
the distance. They were Gunthai and Tabea, and
the hopes of each were great. For might not even
Nu Zhinga do great deeds? Such things had been.</p>

<p>After many days the returning band rode up the
valley that rang with the song of victory. But when
it rode into the village, a great cry went up against
Nu Zhinga, the squaw-hearted. For in the battle
with the Sioux his pony had fallen with an arrow
in its breast, and when the Omahas returned from
the pitiless pursuit of their flying foes, they found
him crying like a squaw over the carcass of the
animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people heard this concerning Nu
Zhinga, an angry cry, like that of a strong wind in
a thicket, passed over the multitude gathered about
the braves. “Let him go work with the squaws!”
they cried. And the unanimous cry of a people is
a law.</p>

<p>So Nu Zhinga, the squaw-hearted, carried water
and wood with the women and was patient. At least
he had Tabea ever near him, which was like living
in the light of perpetual sunrise, and hope, like an
incurable disease, would not leave his breast.</p>

<p>The old woman Gunthai seeing how more than
squaw-hearted her son had grown, sat in her lodge
weaving the baskets of willow. But the hope of her
heart was gone. How she had dreamed of the prowess
of her little man! How he would be mighty
among his people; mighty with the arm that is pitiless
and strong&mdash;a slayer of enemies! But now&mdash;and
the old woman’s thought would check itself at
that barren gulch in the hills through which Death
comes like a blast of bitter winds, for she could see
no further.</p>

<p>So the suns came and went; but there was night
for her in the brightest noon; the seasons passed,
but for her heart there was cold, even in the kind
midsummer.</p>

<p>One day in the time of the cubs (December) it
happened that a child of the village was stricken
with a mysterious sickness. The fierce heat of the
time of the sunflowers blazed in its blood. Its eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
glowed with the brightness of a burning thing. Its
lips muttered strange words that were not the words
of men; and those who listened, trembled. And
after some time, the whole burning body of the child
became one mass of sores.</p>

<p>It was then that Washkahee, the big medicine-man,
came to the lodge of the sick, sang his most potent
songs and performed his most mysterious rites. But
one day the child leaped to its feet and stared at the
wall with eyes that were glazed with terror; then
shrieked and fell back limply into its blankets. And
when the winter had crept into its burning blood,
they buried it upon a hill; and the wonder of the
village was great.</p>

<p>But the end was not yet. Another and another
crept into his blankets, stricken with the same sickness.
Then another and another, until from many
lodges came the moans of the afflicted. Those who
dwelt in the lodges where the scourge entered, fled
from their stricken kinsmen as from the visible body
of Death. They who could laugh back at the challenge
of the Sioux, quailed before the subtle creeping
of this invisible foe. They who were as yet untouched
by the unseen Hand, huddled terrified and
speechless about their fires, in the light of which they
stared at each other and found each face ghastly, as
though it were the mirror of their dread.</p>

<p>In the stillness of their bated breaths they heard
the lonesome monotony of the winter wind and the
swish of the drifting snow, through the drone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which pierced like arrows of ice the occasional shrieks
of the deserted dying or those who battled with grotesque
terrors in the giddy whirl of feverish delirium.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers the women bound blankets
closely across the doors of the lodges, in the hope
of barring out the black spirit that wandered about
the village. Vain hope! Through the walls of the
strongest lodge crept the subtle spirit.</p>

<p>One night the sound of a wild voice crying
through the storm beat into the lodges:</p>

<p>“Washkahee has cried to Wakunda [God] and
lo! Washkahee has dreamed! Only a tuft of hair
from the head of the white bison can save us! So
spoke the dream to Washkahee; who will seek the
white bison?”</p>

<p>It was as though the winter wind had found
words! The people, huddled about their fires, knew
the voice to be that of the big medicine-man, Washkahee,
yet they did not move. The bravest had
become weak as a child at the back of a squaw.</p>

<p>That night Nu Zhinga, lying in the lodge of his
mother, heard the cry that came out of the storm;
and when he slept he dreamed. He had walked far
across the white prairie and his legs were aching with
toil and his heart with despair. Then there broke
upon his dream a mighty roar, and lo! he saw, charging
down upon him, the white bison, tossing the
crusted snow from its lowered horns.</p>

<p>“Tae Ska! Tae Ska!” (white bison) Nu
Zhinga cried, and was awakened by his own voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>So in the early light of the morning, Nu Zhinga
took down the bow and arrows of his father, and
wrapping himself in a buffalo robe, he strode out
into the prairie with his tame wolf trotting at his
heels. To him the dream was an omen. Might he
not find the white bison, and thus drive death from
among his people?</p>

<p>As he walked, the dream that had ever crept like
a slow music through his blood, grew into the swaying
fury of a battle-song. He timed his brisk steps
with a joyous chant that echoed up the frosty valleys.
He would find the white bison! Then his people
would shout his name without derision. Gunthai
would be glad; Tabea would be glad. Tabea!
The word was music.</p>

<p>But meanwhile in the village thicker and thicker
fell the invisible arrows of the Terror; and in the
lodges where they fell dwelt the cry of agony and
delirium and the muffled shriek of death. The old
woman Gunthai and the cripple Tabea were not
spared. The old and the young, the weak and the
strong, the brave and the cowardly found no spell
to ward away the stroke of the hidden Hand.</p>

<p>At length the fear of the tribe grew into a frenzy.
It needed but an incident to lash it into madness.</p>

<p>One evening as the night crept westward across
the hills, a brave leaped upon a pony and yelling
sent the frightened animal flying up the valley. He
was fleeing from the curse that hung over the village.
Then the fear became a madness. The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rushed from their lodges and, fighting for the nearest
pony, fled after the lone rider who had disappeared
into the night.</p>

<p>Those who were too weak or too unfortunate to
gain the back of a pony hung to the mane and were
dragged in the snow until their grips weakened, when
they ran with frantic shrieks after their disappearing
tribesmen. The valley leading from the village became
choked with the fleeing people. Many of the
stricken leaped from their blankets and followed in
the wild rout, until their knees weakened and their
brains swam, when they lay shrieking in the snow
until death came.</p>

<p>From the deserted village the cries of the helpless
followed the unhearing refugees, who fled as the
bison flee when the pitiless hunter follows. Fainter
and fainter grew the yelling until it was swallowed
up in the wind that lashed the spraying snow. When
the morning looked into the valley, it found no
smoke arising from the silent lodges. Only the dead
were there; the dead and the winter.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day after the flight
of the tribe, a lone form topped the hill above the
village and looked down into the still white valley,
where lay the snow-choked lodges, quiet as a dream.
The form was short, and bent as with the toil and
hunger of a long, hard trail. At its heels a gaunt,
grey wolf limped and whimpered with the ache of
emptiness and the frost.</p>

<p>The short, bent form stood still upon the summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and shading its eyes with a hand that trembled, cast
a long and searching gaze upon the lodges of his
people. No smoke, no voice, no roar of fires,
scented with the evening meal!</p>

<p>The form straightened itself and stood with head
thrown back, making a thin and pitiful figure against
the cruel white glare of the icy evening sky. It put
a hand to its mouth, trumpet-wise, and raising the
other above its head, waved about a tuft of long,
grey hair.</p>

<p>“Tae Ska! Tae Ska!”</p>

<p>The voice was scarcely raised above a faint, dry
wheeze that sighed dirge-like above the lifeless valley.
The grey wolf with its four trembling legs
drawn together in the snow, raised its frost-whitened
muzzle to the fading sky and with a long, wild wail
drowned the feebler voice of its master.</p>

<p>With limping stride, grown short and uncertain
as the first steps of a papoose, the form went down
the hillside and entered the village where the Winter
dwelt.</p>

<p>“Tae Ska! Tae Ska! I have found the white
bison!”</p>

<p>The wheezing voice passed among the lodges like
a mournful wind that haunts the lonesome places of
a bluff. Round and round the village went the man
and the wolf, crying into the silent lodges; and the
man’s face was wolflike with weariness and hunger;
and the wolf’s eyes were grown half human with the
pinch of emptiness and frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you not come forth, for I have suffered
and I have the tuft of hair? No more shall the
black spirits dwell among us! Come forth and look
upon the face of him whose heart was the heart of
a squaw!”</p>

<p>The crisp snow whined beneath his step and the
wolf whined beside him. At last the form stopped
before a lodge and with a trembling hand drew away
the covering at the entrance.</p>

<p>It was the lodge of Gunthai. Two forms lay
within, huddled in their blankets, and the snows had
drifted about them. The man pulled the blankets
from their faces. One was Gunthai and the other
Tabea. Each was pinched with the pinch of death
and winter, and the mystery of the last long, lonesome
trail was about them both.</p>

<p>With a moan the form tottered and fell upon its
face in the snow. And over all the valley there were
but two sounds&mdash;the wail of the winter wind and the
howl of a lone wolf.</p>

<p>Days passed, and the people who had fled from
home with the pitiless scourge at their heels grew
faint and weary with their wandering, and at last
the homeache drove them back upon their trail.
Footsore, famished, racked with the now dead terror,
they toiled in silence homeward, where they could die
with the sound of their own fires in their ears.</p>

<p>At last one morning a lone rider cautiously peered
from under the brow of the hill upon the village.
Nothing moved below. He urged his emaciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pony to the summit of the hill and stopping, gazed
again, shading his eyes with a hand grown weak and
thin. There seemed nothing in the valley to fear.
Turning about upon his pony, he raised his arms in
the light of dawn and cried back into the valley beyond
to the waiting remnant of his people&mdash;a long,
exultant cry, for he had looked upon his home.</p>

<p>Slowly the returning tribe, now dwindled to half
its former numbers, toiled up the hill. Only the
strong were left, and now the strong were weak.
The straggling band of men, women and ponies
reached the summit, a pitiful, ragged multitude, and
gazed for a moment into the valley. Then a great
shout arose above the silent spaces, scintillant under
the dawn, as the halting, famished band swooped
down the hill to be again at home.</p>

<p>Again the fires roared upward from the lodges,
and the voices of a happy people drove away the
silence of the winter. There was no longer any disease;
the winter and the flight had purged the tribe.</p>

<p>Who had saved them from the black spirits?
Could a tribe run faster than the things which are
not good?</p>

<p>The sun was at the centre of its short path when
the answer to this question of the tribe broke into
the lodges where the people sat about their steaming
kettles. For it was then that one ran through the
village waving a tuft of long, grey hair and startling
the ears of his people with a shout:</p>

<p>“See! The tuft of hair from the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
white bison! It has saved us; for do you not remember
the words of Washkahee?”</p>

<p>The people rushed from their lodges and thronged
about the man who held the tuft of hair.</p>

<p>“Who has found the white bison?” they cried.</p>

<p>And the answer of him who held the tuft of hair
struck the people silent with wonder:</p>

<p>“It was Nu Zhinga, the squaw-hearted; even he
who could not dream a dream!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE REVOLT OF A SHEEP</p>

<p class="reduct p2">“There is nothing more terrible than the revolt of a sheep,”
said De Marsay.&mdash;<i>Balzac.</i></p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap06">“OH, shut up, Hank! Dang it! Hain’t you
goin’ to let a feller sleep none? How can
I be strong enough to keep from snivellin’
in the mornin’, if I don’t get my sleep?”</p>

<p>A small man with a thin, weak face, that might
have suggested the vacuous countenance of a sheep
had it not been for an expression of anguish and
childish petulance, sat up among a bunch of furs
in the corner of the cabin. He supported himself
tremblingly upon an arm and stared with watery,
haggard eyes upon Hank, who regarded him wistfully.</p>

<p>Hank was a big man and raw-boned. His big,
quiet, hirsute face contrasted strongly with the face
of the other. About his waist hung a belt containing
a pair of six-shooters. Since the dark had fallen
he had been pacing nervously back and forth across
the cabin floor, his eyebrows knit, his face twitching,
now and then offering a soft word of comfort to
the little man who lay among the furs in the corner
breathing fitfully.</p>

<p>“Cuss your hide, Hank! You know I hain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
slep’ none for a week, and you go on a-trampin’ and
a-gabbin’ till you got me all on needles! Why can’t
you leave me be? O damn it!”</p>

<p>The last words were more like a sob than a curse;
and the white, thin face and quivering lips seemed
too impotent for the words. Hank stopped pacing
up and down, and with his fists resting upon his hips
he stared at the little man.</p>

<p>“Now, Sheep,” he drawled kindly, “you hain’t
got no call to talk that away. Hain’t I tryin’ to be
your friend to the finish? I was just thinkin’ to cheer
you up so’s you’d make a respect’ble, manly hangin’.
I didn’t go to rile you.”</p>

<p>The little man thus addressed as “Sheep” drew
himself up into a shivering bunch among the furs
and groaned. The big man shook his head slowly
and sat down, leaning against the wall of the cabin.
“Pore Sheep,” he muttered.</p>

<p>For an hour he sat with his chin in his hands,
staring with pitying eyes upon the huddled little
man, who now and again shook with shuddering
sobs. The candle flame flickered dismally in the
night wind that came in through the chinks in the
wall.</p>

<p>At length a series of stifled groans grew up among
the furs, accompanied by a spasmodic jerking of the
limbs of the little man. With a deep sigh he sat up.
With an imbecile droop of the lower jaw, and eyes
that burned feverishly with utter horror, he stared
at his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“O cuss you, Hank!” he broke out querulously,
“why can’t you talk none? You goin’ to let me
keep a-slippin’ down, down, down right into hell
and never say a word to me? What you settin’ there
like a bump on a log for?”</p>

<p>“W’y, Sheep,” said the big man kindly; “thought
you was tryin’ to snooze.”</p>

<p>“Snooze! How can I snooze with a million little
devils runnin’ up and down my backbone and adancin’
all over my head? You knowed I couldn’t
sleep! You knowed I hain’t slep’ for a week!
Snooze! O damn it! Hain’t I goin’ to get plenty
of snoozin’ when they drag the cart out from ’n
under me in the mornin’?”</p>

<p>Sheep’s voice broke; the fire went out of his eyes;
his teeth chattered as though a sudden gust of winter
had struck him.</p>

<p>“Now, Sheep,” said Hank, “don’t be so riled up
like. I know it’s hard to go out that away; but it
won’t last long, and it can’t hurt much after the first
jerk. I reckon it don’t matter much how a feller
goes out after he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut that up!”</p>

<p>The little man leaned against the wall and closed
his eyes. After a considerable silence the big man
produced a flask of liquor and spoke soothingly.</p>

<p>“Want a drink, Sheepy, old man?”</p>

<p>The little man leaped up with a glimmer of hope
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Course I do! What made you keep a-hidin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>’
it when you knowed all along that’s what I been
wantin’?”</p>

<p>He grasped the flask and drank with great eager
gulps until it was empty. Then he sat down against
the cabin wall, staring fixedly at the candle flame.
The empty, sheepish, cowardly face began to gain
expression as the liquor mounted to his head. A
light of fearlessness began to grow in his eyes. Lines
appeared and deepened in his thin face, suggesting
at once a certain degree of mastery and infinite malevolence.
The wolf that lurks somewhere in the
fastness of every man’s soul had come forth and
routed the sheep.</p>

<p>“What in thunder you doin’ with all that heavy
artillery hangin’ to you, Hank? Take ’em off! I
don’t need no guards. Who said I was thinkin’ of
breakin’ camp? I hain’t tryin’ to run, am I? Damn
me, I’m glad I done it and I’m a-goin’ to walk right
straight into hell a-grinnin’! Sheep, am I?”</p>

<p>The little man laughed a strange laugh that had
the snarl of a mad wolf in it; a moment since he had
been bleating like a scared lamb.</p>

<p>“You set there and listen. Sheep, sheep, sheep!
That’s what they all been a-callin’ me, but when I
get done tellin’ you about it, I guess you won’t call
me no sheep. Hain’t a danged one of you big fellers
as would ’ve done it up better ’n me!</p>

<p>“You’ve knowed me quite a spell, Hank; and you
never knowed no bad of me till now, did you? And I
hain’t had any easy trail most of the time neither.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
When I was jest a little feller goin’ to country school
back East, the other fellers always picked onto me
’cause I was so easy to pick onto. Never had a fight
in my life. Always scared to death of fightin’;
sucked it in with my mother’s milk, I guess. Used
to get off alone and bawl ’cause I couldn’t make
myself fight.</p>

<p>“Never was a real boy; always a kind of a stray
sheep, bleatin’ around in lonesome places. Guess
I must look like a sheep; anyway the boys called me
that; and it stuck. Pretty hard bein’ a sheep amongst
wolves, Hank!</p>

<p>“I was always shy and easy scared, Hank. I
never owned it to a livin’ man before; but a man is
like to say things just before he goes out for good
that he wouldn’t say before.</p>

<p>“You knowed ol’ man Leclerc, didn’t you? <i>Her</i>
dad, you know. Used to live down-river half a day’s
hard walkin’. I reckon that ol’ man was about the
best friend I ever had, ’ceptin’ you, Hank. Kind of
seemed to understand me like. Wonder if he’s
hearin’ me now! Don’t give a damn if he is! He
knowed it wasn’t in me to be bad, and he knows I
done right. I tell you, Hank, I ain’t scared, nor
’shamed nor nothin’. Damn me, I can see Donahan
a-dyin’ yet, and it does me good, Hank! Does me
good!”</p>

<p>The little man’s eyes blazed, and his face seemed
to take fire from them. But the light died as quickly
as it was kindled, like a fire in too little fuel whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
by a wind too strong. A soft light of reminiscence
lingered where the fiercer glow had died.</p>

<p>“Used to go down there pretty often when I
could; part to see the ol’ man, and most to see his
girl. Nice little thing, Hank; awful nice little thing!
Don’t you think so? Good as an angel, too, but
weak like a woman can be. I hain’t nothin’ again’
her, Hank&mdash;so help me God, I hain’t! I wasn’t the
man for her. She’d ought to ’ve had a big, strong,
quiet feller what wasn’t afraid of the devil. Some
feller like you, Hank&mdash;or Donahan.</p>

<p>“Oh, let the hottest fires in hell eat Donahan!”</p>

<p>The little man shook with a passion that seemed
grotesque, because it was too big for him.</p>

<p>“And I kep’ goin’ down there, and goin’ down
there, till I begun to be happy, Hank. Begun to
thinkin’ part of this world was made for me. Begun
to thinkin’ about havin’ a woman and babies; and
somehow I got to feelin’ bigger and stronger, and
not sneakin’ any more.</p>

<p>“‘Peared like the girl liked me. Never had
nothin’ to do with no woman ’cept my mother, you
know. Oh, Hank, why can’t a feller be a man when
he wants to so bad? I dunno. I tried.</p>

<p>“Well, one time I went down there and ol’ man
Leclerc was pretty sick. Said he was a-goin’ to die
sure thing. Wheezin’ already and pickin’ at the
blankets. Calls me up to him, and after he got
done tellin’ me what he was goin’ to do d’rectly, he
says: ‘Sheep, my boy, I’ve brought her up as near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
like a French lady as I knowed how. She hain’t
able to hustle for herself, and&mdash;well, ain’t she a
pretty girl? Why the devil don’t you ask me for
her?’</p>

<p>“And I asked, and the ol’ man said ‘yes,’ and
that was his last word, ’cept ‘God be with both of
you.’ Took all his breath to say that, seemed like.</p>

<p>“And so I saw the ol’ man under ground and
come up here with the girl. Got the missionary,
Father Donahan, to do the tyin’. (Oh, damn him!)
And then I begun to be happy. Seemed like God
heard the ol’ man for a spell, tho’ his voice was weak
when he said it. Now I guess mebbe he didn’t hear.
Does he always hear, Hank?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” muttered the big man, who sat with
his face in his hands; “seems like He ain’t out here
’t all, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, will you?” peevishly snapped the
little man. “Le’ me talk! <i>You</i> got plenty of time
for talkin’! Le’ <i>me</i> talk, will you?”</p>

<p>The big man sighed, and the other continued
rapidly in a sort of a dazed sing-song voice with
little inflection in it, like a man in a trance.</p>

<p>“Big change come over me then; better man all
’round. Factor saw it and sent me on some long
trips; seemed to trust me more’n before. But I
always done the longest trips in the shortest poss’ble
time. Doted on that girl wife, and I guess I was
about the happiest feller that ever cussed a pack
mule. Used to like to set around the cabin when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
could and watch her skip about the place makin’
things comfort’ble like a woman can when she’s a
mind.</p>

<p>“And by and by I was happier’n ever. That was
when the little boy come. Cute little feller, that
boy was. Don’t you mind? Had blue eyes, and that
tickled me half to death, ’cause black eyes is the rule
in my fambly and hers, and it seemed like God was
tryin’ to be kind to me.</p>

<p>“When Father Donahan christened the young’n,
I drawed his attention to them blue eyes and Donahan
(no, I ain’t goin’ to call him Father no more,
’cause if he was a priest, he was a priest of the
devil!) What was I sayin’?”</p>

<p>At the sound of Donahan’s name upon his own
lips, the little man’s face writhed into malevolent
contortions.</p>

<p>“What was I sayin’?” he repeated dazedly.</p>

<p>“Blue eyes,” suggested Hank.</p>

<p>“Quit breakin’ in onto me that away!” snapped
the little man peevishly. “And when I showed him
the blue eyes, Donahan grinned and said, ‘Yes, God
had been very kind.’ And it did look like it,
didn’t it?</p>

<p>“Donahan named the boy; asked me if I’d let him.
Called him James for a front name and Donahan for
a middle one. Well, things went along smooth until
one day the little feller died. Made me feel pretty
bad&mdash;like to tore my heart out. But Donahan he
come and cried too, and that helped. Always helps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to have somebody feel bad with you; don’t you think
so?</p>

<p>“After that things dragged on like they have a
way of doin’. I kep’ on tryin’ to be like a man. But
the girl, she seemed to be takin’ it pretty hard. Got
stranger and stranger toward me, like as if she didn’t
care for me no more. Donahan used to come in
often and console her, and she seemed to brighten
up at them times&mdash;’cause she was always strong on
the religion business. That’s what made her so
good, I guess.</p>

<p>“But by and by there was goin’ to be another
youngster, and I kind of got into the way of whistlin’
again somehow. Got to thinkin’ how it’d be a boy
with blue eyes like the one that died. About that
time the Factor sent me off on a long trip. Hated
to go, but it couldn’t be helped. You’d ought to
seen me travel, Hank! Wantin’ to get back, you
know; ’feared all the time mebbe she was sick and
a-wantin’ me. Made a quick trip&mdash;quicker’n most
big men could, Hank. And when I come in sight
of home, I was that glad that I couldn’t feel my feet
and legs achin’.</p>

<p>“It was night when I got back, and I thought
I’d just take a peep in at the winder before I went
in; light was shinin’ out so home-like. You know
how a boy looks a long time at a big, red apple before
he eats it; gettin’ his eyes full of it before he
fills his belly? That was like me.</p>

<p>“I crep’ up and looked in; winder was raised a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
little. I could see Donahan inside and he was talkin’
soft and low.</p>

<p>“‘Hope it’ll have blue eyes,’ he was sayin’; ‘blue
eyes like mine.’ And that made me love Donahan
more, ’cause it was just what I was a-wishin’ myself.
Talked along quite a spell, and me watchin’ outside,
all the time pityin’ Donahan ’cause he couldn’t never
have no little woman like that and a youngster with
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“And the talkin’ growed into a mumble and hum
like as if I was a-dreamin’ it all in a happy dream;
until all to oncet some of the words leaped out of the
hum, and stood out clear like so many candle flames
a-burnin’ into my head, and a-scorchin’ my backbone,
and a-settin’ the whole world afire with bloody light.</p>

<p>“I held onto the winder sill to keep from fallin’
down, and this is what I heard: ‘Sometimes I feel
sorry for the pore sheep; and I’ve spent many nights
prayin’ to God about it and askin’ him to forgive
me. Then when I see you again, it all comes back
and the prayers are no more than so many curses.
What’d you ever marry that sheep for? Curse the
day that I was made a priest!’</p>

<p>“And then the words seemed to get muffled, only
now and then I could hear some of ’em plain, and
every one of ’em was like a big man’s fist drivin’
into my face and a-beatin’ my eyes full of blood.”</p>

<p>The little man covered his face with his hands
and sobbed.</p>

<p>“O, I ain’t a-blamin’ her, Hank,” he blubbered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
“Never was a better woman. I ain’t blamin’
her.”</p>

<p>He rocked himself back and forth for some time.
His sobbing ceased. Suddenly he raised his face
and the flames of hell glittered in his tear-washed
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m a white-livered coward, so I didn’t go in
and kill him. He was a big man, and I ain’t no
fighter. I run; don’t know why. Didn’t feel sore
nor achy in my legs no more. I run and run and run
till my breath give out, then I fell down and the
stars swum ’round and went out. Then after awhile
I was up and walkin’, and nothin’ would stand still.
Things danced round and round me and the air was
full of little spiteful, spittin’ lights and sounds like
devils a-laughin’. And by and by I come to ol’ man
Leclerc’s place. Don’t know why I went there.
Nothin’ there but the <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>“I went in and laid down on the floor all broke
up. And when I went to sleep, I dreamed of killin’
Donahan. I woke up and it was mornin’.</p>

<p>“First thing I heard was the rattle of some Red
River carts goin’ north. I guess it was the devil that
whispered somethin’ in my ear then. I run out and
told a big lie to the bull-whackers. ‘Man a-dyin’ in
here! Go as fast as you can to the next post and tell
Father Donahan to come down to see the pore
devil through with it!’</p>

<p>“Guess I looked like I’d been settin’ up for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
week, so the bull-whackers believed it and went on
north a-whackin’ their bulls into a swingin’ trot.</p>

<p>“Well, Donahan come all right.”</p>

<p>Here the little man lapsed into a stubborn silence.
He leaned against the wall and for several hours
there was no sound in the cabin but that of heavy
breathing.</p>

<p>At length Hank got up and walked over to the
little window. A dull grey blur had grown up in
the East. It would soon be time. Hank sighed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little man was aroused from his
lethargy as though he had heard a shout. He began
talking rapidly.</p>

<p>“I stood behind the door of the cabin, and when
he come in I downed him with a club. Then I tied
his hands and his feet and fastened him to the floor.
I sat beside him and spit in his face till he come to
a-groanin’. And it was a couple days before he could
talk sense or knowed who I was.</p>

<p>“And he begged and he cussed, but I didn’t say
nothin’. He got hungry; so I chawed at some pemmican
I had left from the trip so’s he’d get hungrier.
He got thirsty; so I drank more’n I wanted so’s
he’d get thirstier.</p>

<p>“Said he’d get me into heaven for just one sup
of water; so I went out with my cup; I filled it with
dust; I put it to his lips.</p>

<p>“Said he’d send me to hell if I didn’t give him
just one drop. So I give him more dust. And by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
by he got luny like, and cussed like a bull-whacker
and whined like a sick woman by turns.</p>

<p>“God, Hank! How that man hung on!</p>

<p>“And by and by he seemed to get a little sense for
a spell, and he yelled out: ‘<i>He had blue eyes,
didn’t he? Look at mine!</i>’ And I cuffed him in
the mouth till his teeth was bloody, ’cause his eyes
was blue.”</p>

<p>The little man hesitated. Suddenly an expression
of supreme terror came over his face. The wolf
was dead&mdash;the frightened sheep looked out of his
eyes. There was a sound of footsteps. The shabby
light of early dawn had already cheapened the glow
of the guttered candle.</p>

<p>The door opened&mdash;a priest entered.</p>

<p>The little man gave a yell of terror and shrank
into his corner.</p>

<p>“<i>Take it away, Hank!</i>” he screamed. “<i>Take
it away!</i>”</p>

<p>Hank spoke a few words into the ear of the priest,
who muttered a prayer and went out. For some
time the little man stared appealingly into the eyes
of the bigger man. When he spoke his voice was
husky and low: “Won’t you look after the woman
a little, Hank? If it’s got blue eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was now a sound of other footsteps approaching.
The little man gasped like one who has
suddenly been thrust into cold water.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hank!” he moaned; “hold me tight. Don’t
let ’em take me! They’ll stand me in the cart under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a tree and they’ll put the rope around my neck and
they’ll drag the cart away! <i>Oh!</i>”</p>

<p>The footsteps were now very near the door. The
little man on a sudden became very quiet. He bit
nervously at his finger-tips. His body stiffened. His
face seemed transparent.</p>

<p>When the sound of a hand at the latch was heard,
his jaw dropped nervelessly. He stared upon the
soon-to-be-opened door with wide, dilated eyes, in
which all that had been human was burned to dust.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MARK OF SHAME</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the old times there were two brothers, Seha
and Ishneda; and because of hate for him,
they did many acts of unkindness to a man
whose name was Shonga Saba.</p>

<p>And one night a man was killed and the man was
Ishneda. So with the coming of the light, a whisper
ran about the village, saying “Shonga Saba has
killed.” And the whisper was true; for Shonga Saba
sat in his lodge all day, speaking no word. And
when any came to speak, he lifted his lip in a bad
way and snarled. A sick wolf does so.</p>

<p>It happened that morning that some hunters went
forth, for it was the time for the hunting of bison
and the tribe was resting on the trail. And when
the hunters returned, their eyes were like the eyes
of a scared deer. They told a story that frightened
the people. They had shot at three elk and their
aim was true; but the arrows came out on the other
side&mdash;bloodless. And the elk changed into wolves,
running away very swiftly.</p>

<p>So they who were wise saw famine coming. They
recalled old times; how the game had often failed
after a murder. For the spirit of the dead man
makes it so. And the wise old men told these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and the old women said it had been so; they
remembered.</p>

<p>So there was a space of little speaking, for Fear
sat upon tongues.</p>

<p>When the sun was going down, the people gathered
about the big chief’s tepee where the fathers
were sitting with great thoughts. They did not
smoke nor talk. They shivered as the long shadows
crept out of the hills&mdash;yet it was the brown hot
time.</p>

<p>And when it was dusk a chief made words which
were whispers: “Let a <i>wachoobay</i> [holy man]
take strong weapons and travel the back trail till the
middle of the night, that he may meet the spirit
that comes and kill it; for Famine walks with the
spirit that comes, and there shall be the wailing of
children and many flat bellies.”</p>

<p>And the <i>wachoobay</i> went forth with strong
weapons. He took the back trail; he looked straight
ahead. And the people stared after him until the dark
came between, as he walked to meet the two comers.</p>

<p>Then the chief’s voice went over the people in the
darkness, for the fires were not lit; an enemy was
coming, and there is safety in darkness: “Let him
who killed come among us.” So one went and
brought the man.</p>

<p>He stood among the people, felt but not seen;
and with him came a sobbing that grew into
words: “I, Shonga Saba, am here; and I have
killed. Have my people seen a bison bull stung with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a fly until he tore the earth with his horns? It was
so. After a long time of heat the storm comes out
of the night; it does angry deeds, and in the morning
it is past. It was so. My breast aches. I struck
my enemy, but myself I struck also. Something has
died within me. So I go to do as the others have
done. I will take the punishment.”</p>

<p>And though the people did not hear nor see him
go, they knew that he was gone. That night only
the children slept.</p>

<p>When Shonga Saba reached his tepee, he did that
which was the custom. He cut his hair, he took off
his garments, he smeared his forehead with mud.
Of tears and dust he made the mud. Upon his forehead
he put the mark of his shame.</p>

<p>From the peak of his tepee, where the smoke
comes out, he tore the rawhide flap. It was blackened
with the smoke of many fires. About his
shoulders he bound it; and it was the garment of
his shame.</p>

<p>And then he went forth from the camp. He
pitched a lonesome tepee without the circle of his
people; for thus he should live four summers and
four winters. It was the custom.</p>

<p>And in the first light his woman came to him with
water and cooked meat. Also, she brought moaning.
Shonga Saba spoke no word nor looked up.
The mud of tears and dust was upon his forehead,
and the blackened garment of shame was upon his
shoulders. There was a lump in his throat; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
water did not wash it away. There was an emptiness
in him; but the meat did not fill it. And when
he cut the meat, which was well cooked, the man
groaned, for blood ran forth and made the food
look like a wound.</p>

<p>Again the tribe took up the trail; they wanted to
find the bison, for there was little meat. And the
man followed at the distance of an arrow’s flight
behind his moving people, for such was the custom.
But no thunder of bison came from the brown
valleys where the trail went; neither was there any
dust cloud of pawing hoofs. And the old women
remembered old-time famines, and their hands
trembled as they pitched the tepees in the dusk that
ended the day’s toil.</p>

<p>And in the mornings the old men gazed into the
shining distance, looking from under their hands
with eyes that glared as in battle. And all day,
sweating and toiling on the trail, the people ate the
distance with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Round bellies flattened; for the evil days had
come.</p>

<p>And the man who had killed saw all this. He
too walked with hunger and something bigger than
the food-wish. Also lonesomeness was ever by his
side. In the nights he felt the mark upon his forehead
like the sting of an angry knife; and the smoke-flap
was as a fire upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>And one night he said: “I have brought these
days of toiling without food upon my people. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was for this that my mother groaned at my coming.
I should have been the food of wolves on that day
when my eyes were not yet open. I will go away,
for evil walks with me, and my feet scatter trouble
in the trail. My woman is as one who has no man,
and my children are as a stranger’s children. I will
walk far and seek peace among other peoples,
among strange hills and valleys.”</p>

<p>And he went in the night.</p>

<p>He was far into the lonesome places&mdash;and it was
morning. He was weak with the night walking, for
famine had made him thin. So he lifted his face and
his hands to the sun. His palms he turned to the
young light and he spoke earnest words to the Spirit:
“Wakunda, trouble have I met, and trouble have
my people met through me. Help me to walk in the
good trail!”</p>

<p>And as he said the words, a cloud passed across
the sun; it was like a smutch of mud across a shining
forehead. The man who had killed, groaned. He
hid his face in the grass that he might not see the
mark of his shame. But as the day grew older the
hunger pinched more, and the man got up, set his
face away from the sun, and went on further into
the lonesome places. And in the evening he killed
a rabbit with his bow and arrows. And as the rabbit
leaped up at the sting of the arrow, it made a pitiful
sound like that of a man struck deep with a knife
in his sleep.</p>

<p>And the man fled, for a strange sickness had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
gripped him. The mark upon his forehead burned,
and the smoke-flap was as a heavy burden upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p>In the last light he found wild turnips and ate.
They could not cry out; they could not bleed. And
then sleep came, but not rest. While his body slept,
his spirit killed Ishneda over and over again. And
he saw the first light with haggard eyes.</p>

<p>And when he had eaten again of the wild turnips
he said: “I will go to the village of the Poncas;
they will take me in, for I will speak soft words.”
That day he travelled, and the next and the next.
But two others had travelled faster than he&mdash;Famine
and the Story of his bad deed; for none travel so
fast as these. And these two had travelled across
the prairie together.</p>

<p>And after much walking, Shonga Saba came to
the top of a hill and turned hungry eyes upon the
Ponca village in the valley. It was the time when
the old day throws big shadows. He stood thin,
bent against the sky. The smoke-flap at his shoulders
lifted in the wind that the eyes in the valley
might see.</p>

<p>And a dead hush crept over the village; the sound
of children died; the people disappeared. Full of
wonder and fear, the lean, lonesome one walked with
halting step down the dry hillside. He entered the
village, and it was as a place where all are dead.</p>

<p>He came to the centre of the village. He lifted
his palms and made a piteous cry, which was like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
dry wind moving in a wilderness. And then the
head of an old man was thrust forth from a tent-flap,
and from it came a husky voice: “Begone, O
Bringer of Famine!”</p>

<p>And the man went forth. His head was bent,
his shoulders stooped as with a weight. He walked
far and met the Night. He lay down in its shadow.
His forehead ached, and the smoke-flap was as a
burning brand. And in the darkness he made a cry:
“Wakunda, very far have I walked seeking peace;
but it has fled before me. Help me to find the good
trail!”</p>

<p>He was very tired, and on a sudden it was day
again, and the dew was upon him. He found wild
turnips and ate. He drank at a little creek that ran
very thin among dying reeds. Then he walked, he
knew not where. But now and then he whispered
bitter words into the lonesome air: “In the land of
the spirits is peace; there I would walk, but I cannot
find the trail.”</p>

<p>The day was very hot. The prairie wavered in
the heat; the bugs droned; the light wind sighed in
the dry grasses like a thirsty thing. The far hills
seemed floating in a lake of thin oil. They looked
lean and hungry, yellow as with a fever; and upon
their sides the dry earth was broken like old sores.</p>

<p>Into the heat-drone the man sent his sighing. His
feet were heavy; he wished to die, he wished to die.</p>

<p>And when the day was past the highest place, a
rumbling grew below the rim of the earth, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
galloping of many bison&mdash;a sound of anger. And a
cloud arose, black and flashing with fires across its
front. The sky was as an eye of fever and the cloud
closed slowly over it like a big eyelid.</p>

<p>Then a hush fell. There was no moving of air,
no droning of bugs. The prairie held its breath;
and the cloud came on. It moved in silence. It
threw long, ragged arms ahead of it, long, eager
arms. And out of it leaped flames, like the spurt
and sputter of a wind-blown camp fire in the night.</p>

<p>And in the hush the man heard strange sounds on
a sudden. There was a crying and a shouting of
battle cries. He reached the bald top of a hill and
saw below him a fighting of many warriors. Bitterly
they fought, as wolves fight in hunger. There was
the lifting and falling of war clubs, the shrieking of
arrows. Sounds of horror cut the big stillness like
many knives.</p>

<p>And the man’s heart leaped with joy&mdash;for here
was death; this was the beginning of the trail that
led to peace.</p>

<p>With a cry he rushed from the summit. He ran
with very young legs to meet Death, for he wished
to die.</p>

<p>But on a sudden the warring bands ceased crying.
The war clubs were not lifted, the arrows flew no
more. On rushed the thin, bent runner from the
hilltop, and the smoke-flap flaunted itself behind him.
As in a dream the warriors stared upon the wild
runner. Then a hoarse shout went up: “The Famine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Bringer! The Famine Bringer!” Stricken with
a common fear, they fled. And the storm broke
upon the valley. It poured down water and fire upon
one who lay there upon his face. It roared, it
shrieked, it flamed about him; but he moved not.</p>

<p>His breast ached with the ache of the lonesome,
for even Death had fled him. And when the storm
had passed, the stillness came back like a new pain.
The drenched man arose and saw the blood-red sun
slip down a ridge of steaming hills.</p>

<p>And near him lay one who had been killed with
an arrow. The feathers stood forth from his breast.
His face had the look of much pain; his hands
gripped at the wet grass. And the lonesome one
looked long upon the dead man, thinking deep
thoughts. “Even the dead have pain,” he said, “and
they seek to hold to the good earth. See how he
clutches it! I shall live and follow my trail, for on
all trails there is pain; and Wakunda wishes me to
live.”</p>

<p>So he dressed himself in the garments of the dead
warrior who needed them no more. He threw away
the smoke-flap, and in a gully that roared with rapid
waters, he washed the smutch from his forehead&mdash;the
mud of dust and tears. And he said: “Now
will I walk straight again, for the marks of my shame
are gone. I will seek the Otoes, and they will take
me in.”</p>

<p>Is it not the way of a man to seek better things?</p>

<p>And it happened that in the village of the Otoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
was much joy and much feasting. For the bison had
come back; the famine was ended.</p>

<p>And it was dark. The lonesome one sighted the
feast fires from far off and caught the far-blown scent
of boiling kettles. They had the home-smell. His
heart was glad as he entered the village and went in
among the feast fires. And they about the fires said:
“Who walks in from the night?” And Shonga
Saba said: “A lonesome man, one with many
stories to tell.”</p>

<p>They sat him down, for stories are good with
feasting. And he told a story while the meat went
round and the kettles simmered and the embers
crackled and went blue. And as he told, the people
gathered close about to hear. They leaned forward,
they breathed heavily, they stared. For his story
was of a brave one who suffered much; it sounded
true; there was an ache in his words. Also it had in
it the muttering of war drums, the wails of women in
the night, the snarl of bow thongs, the beat of hoofs.</p>

<p>But as the teller raised his face, glowing with the
noble deeds of which he told, he saw the circled mass
of staring faces, moulded with the terrors of the tale
and lit blue with falling embers.</p>

<p>What did they see that they stared so? <i>The
mark!</i></p>

<p>The story-teller leaped to his feet. As a wounded
man he cried out: “It is not washed away!” He
threw his arms across his forehead and fled through
the parting throng into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he had run far from something that
followed yet made no sound, he cast himself down
on the prairie and cried to the Spirit: “Wakunda,
with water I washed it away, but it is not gone! Am
I a wolf to howl always in the wilderness? I have
the ache for home. I wish to hear laughter and be
clean. Help me to find the trail!”</p>

<p>All night his words felt about in the dark for
Wakunda.</p>

<p>The next day his wanderings began anew. And
after many sunlights the first frost gripped the prairie,
and the snows came. More and more the lonesome
one thought of the fires of his people. Through
the shivering nights the tang of the home-smoke
filled his nostrils; and day by day the homeache
grew.</p>

<p>So his weary feet followed his longing, and the
trail led home. But there was no greeting. In an
empty lodge without the village he made a fire that
held the winter off but left him shivering. And once
again his woman came with sobbing and a downcast
face, bringing water and meat. He ate and drank,
yet thirst and hunger stayed. In the nights he looked
wistfully upon the fires of his people burning little
days out of the darkness. He wished to be beside
them and hear the laughter, for the famine had
passed, and there was joy.</p>

<p>And often by day, Seha, the brother of the man
who was killed, came with taunting and words that
wounded as a whip-thong. But the lonesome one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
made no answer, for having suffered much, he was
wise. And this was against the law of the fathers;
so it happened one day that Seha was bound to a
post in the centre of the village, and the whippers
were there with elkhorn whips to punish Seha.</p>

<p>Then was a strange deed done, which even yet the
old men tell of to the youths. From his lodge ran
the lonesome one and stood before the whippers.
The long silence he broke with words: “Spare Seha
and bind me to the post, for mine was the bad deed.
I have suffered much and now I can see.”</p>

<p>And the old fathers, who were wise, said: “Let
it be as the man says.” And it was done. The lonesome
one was bound to the post and took the lashes
on his back. He made no cry, nor was there any
wincing of his face. And it happened that in his
pain he sought out the face of Seha in the throng.
It was no longer hard with hate.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, as the whips hissed about him,
a light went across the face of the lonesome one&mdash;a
strange, bright light. And seeing this, the arms of
the whippers faltered, for it was very strange.</p>

<p>Then in the silence that fell, the man raised a soft
voice: “At last the mark has left me! Bring my
children to look upon me, and let my woman sing!
I have found peace; for the mark of tears and dust
is gone&mdash;I know not how.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BEATING OF THE WAR DRUMS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">HE could never be a strong <i>waschusha</i>
(brave). When he was born he was no
bigger than a baby coyote littered in a terrible
winter after a summer of famine! That was
what the braves said as they sat in a circle about the
fires; and often one would catch him, spanning his
little brown legs with a contemptuous forefinger and
thumb, while the others made much loud mirth over
this bronze mite who could never be a brave.</p>

<p>Then the object of their mirth would pull away
from his tormentors, displaying his teeth with a
whimper that was half a growl, and would slink
away into the shades where the firelight did not
reach. Whereupon the braves would call after him
in their good-natured cruelty: “Mixa Zhinga!
Mixa Zhinga!” (Little Wolf).</p>

<p>So, in accordance with certain infallible psychic
laws, Little Wolf became what he was considered,
and fulfilled his wild name to the letter.</p>

<p>One day in one of his most vulpine moods, while
trotting among the hills on all fours, stopping now
and then to sit upon his haunches and give forth a
series of howls in imitation of his namesakes, he had
discovered a deserted wolf’s hole in the hillside, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
which he immediately made himself the growling
possessor.</p>

<p>To make this play metempsychosis the more real,
he had spirited from the tepee of his father a complete
wolf’s hide, clad in which he spent the greater
part of the time prowling about among the hills with
an intense wolfish hate for all humankind gnawing
at his heart.</p>

<p>One summer evening Little Wolf, sitting upon the
top of the hill, gazed down upon the circle of
tepees which was the village of his people. As he
looked, the silent vow he had taken, never to go back
to his tribe again, but to be a wolf with the wolves,
slowly became shapeless, then indistinct, then it vanished
altogether. For the smoke, rising slowly from
the various fires, told a bewitching tale of supper to
his eyes; and the light wind brought to his keen
nostrils the scent of boiling kettles, which acted as a
sort of footnote to the tale of the smoke, finally
clinching the argument of the text!</p>

<p>So the little wolf fell from his high resolve as the
wolf skin fell from his back, and he forthwith trotted
down the hillside, at every step degenerating, as he
thought, into just a common <i>zhinga zhinga</i> (baby).</p>

<p>Having cautiously approached a fire, Little Wolf
sat upon the ground with his knees huddled up to his
chin, and watched the deft hands of the women tending
the baking of the squaw corn cakes and the
yellow <i>watuh</i> (pumpkin) in the embers.</p>

<p>The old women, their backs bent with their loads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
carried bundles of faggots from a thicket near by and
placed them upon the fires, that flared up with a
sound like the wind’s, making a small circular day
amid the gathering shadows. The air was pleasant
with the scent of boiling kettles, some filled with the
meat of the <i>tae</i> or the <i>tachuga</i> (bison and antelope);
some ebullient with the savoury <i>zhew munka</i>, the tea
of the prairie. And as Little Wolf sat and looked
upon the suggestive scene, a great wave of sympathetic
kindness passed through his small body.</p>

<p>And especially did the wolfishness of his little
heart melt into an indefinite feeling of love for humanity
as his eyes followed the form of the maiden
Hinnagi as she bustled with her mother about the
kettles. Already in his childish mind he was wielding
the stone axe with mighty force in some mysterious
battle among the hills; and it was all for her.
His eyes grew big with the dream he was dreaming.
He stared into the fire as he thought the thoughts of
ambitious youth.</p>

<p>The flame fell and crept into the embers. Then
reality came back as the shadows came. Something
of the wonted wolfishness tugged at his heart as he
thought of what the braves had said. He could
never be a strong brave! With an awful bitterness
this thought grew upon him, and even a full stomach
could not quite ease the pang.</p>

<p>After the evening meal the war drums were
brought into the open space about which the tepees
were built. For upon the morrow the entire band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the tribe’s warriors would go out against their
enemies, the Sioux, and to-night they would dance
the war dance that their courage might not fail.</p>

<p>The drums were placed in a small circle; before
each an old man, who had seen many battles ere the
eagle glance faded from his eye, sat cross-legged,
holding a drumstick in either hand. About these
the braves gathered in a larger circle. The yellow
and red light of the boisterous camp fires made more
terrible their faces fierce with the war paint.</p>

<p>In another circle at some distance from that of
the braves, awaited the women, dressed in their
brightest garments of dyed buckskin. At a signal
from the head chief of the tribe, the snarling thunder
of the war drums began. The two motionless
circles suddenly became two rings of gyrating colour.
The beaded moccasins twinkled like a chain of satellites
swinging about the faggot fire for a sun. The
shout of the braves arose above the cadence of the
drum beats, and the monotonous song of the women
grew like a night wind in a lonesome valley.</p>

<p>Tum-tum-um-um, tum-tum-um-um, went the
drums, ever faster, ever louder, inciting the dancers
to delirious fury. The neglected fires dwindled into
embers. The shout of the braves and the droning
of the women ceased. Darkness fell upon the circles.
The dancers moved swiftly through the dusk
like ghosts in a midnight orgy. There was no sound
save the snarling beat of the drums and the shuffle
of wild feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the moon, big-eyed with wonder, arose
above the hills, pouring a weird light upon the dance.
Little Wolf, who had been huddling closely against
a tepee with an unintelligible fear, now felt the delirium
of the dance for the first time. He leaped to
his feet with a shout that echoed strange and hoarse
from the hills! The whole village, as if awakened
from the spell, caught up the cry and sent it trembling
up the gulches!</p>

<p>With the hot blood pounding at his temples, Little
Wolf swung into the frenzy of the dance. He
leaped like the antelope when it catches the scent
of the hunter. He was no longer the <i>zhinga zhinga</i>
who could never be a brave. The fanaticism of the
savage was upon him. With his head thrown back
until it caught the full glare of the moon, he danced.
It was not a child’s face that the pale light struck;
it was the face of a fiend! The unfettered wind of
the prairie was in his lungs! The swiftness of the
elk was in his feet! He danced until the hills danced
about him in a dance of their own. He danced until
the moon reeled like a sick man! He danced until
his chest felt crushed as with the hug of a grizzly!
He danced until the stars and the moon went out,
and there was nothing but darkness and a deep, deep
oppressive something, like and unlike slumber, upon
him! The sun was far up in the heavens when he
awoke lying upon the ground where he had fallen with
fatigue. He rubbed his eyes and stared about him;
the circles of the dance had vanished; the war drums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
were still. The warriors had ridden out of the
village into the mysterious region beyond the hills
where great deeds awaited to be done. Only the
women and the children and the old men remained in
the village.</p>

<p>Then there came upon Little Wolf that overpowering
thought of bitterness. He was only a
<i>zhinga zhinga</i>; he could never be a brave. No, but
he would be a wolf! He would live in howling loneliness
among the hills!</p>

<p>Yet that day as he prowled about, clad in his
wolf skin, he was conscious of not being half so
good a wolf as he had been the day before. He did
not find it quite within his power to hate his people
with whom he had felt the delirium of the war dance.
The snarling beat of the war drums had awakened
in him a vital interest in the great prairie tragedy of
food-getting and war-making.</p>

<p>Several days passed, and the warriors had not returned.
Little Wolf was sitting beside the deserted
hole which was his den, thinking great thoughts of
the future as he basked in the horizontal glare of the
evening sun. As he looked with half-shut eyes across
the hills, his dreaming was suddenly arrested by the
sight of what seemed a number of bunches of grass
moving along the brow of the hill on the other side
of the valley in which the village lay. As he looked
and wondered at this fantastic dance of the grasses,
there was a wild shout from the opposite hill, and a
small band of Otoes, their heads covered with grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that they might the more easily creep upon their
foes, rushed down the hillside toward the defenceless
village.</p>

<p>Terrified by the suddenness of the attack, Little
Wolf scampered into his hole like any other little
wolf, and crouched in the darkness shivering with
fear. Some time passed, during which he could hear
the wail of the women and the victorious cries of the
Otoes; then the noises ceased. With a great pang
of remorse, the consciousness of his cowardice came
upon Little Wolf. He had crawled into a hole like
a badger!</p>

<p>Then he thought of Hinnagi.</p>

<p>He crawled out of the hole and ran down the hill
into the village with his wolf skin still upon him.
There amid the tepees he saw the bodies of some
of the old men who had attempted resistance, but the
time of their strength was passed.</p>

<p>“Hinnagi! Hinnagi!” called Little Wolf. He
listened, and heard only the wail of the women from
the lodges.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the Otoes to carry off the
fairest daughters of the enemy as the spoil of war.
Little Wolf thought of this with a great pang at his
heart. A great indefinite resolve of heroism came
upon him. He ran out of the village and down the
valley, keeping the trail of the enemy. When he
had gone some distance, he came upon some ponies
that the Otoes had abandoned for the fresher ones
from the herds of the Omahas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Catching one of these, weary with a long trail, he
mounted it and turned its head down the trail of the
Otoes, urging its weary limbs into a gallop by plying
his heels upon its ribs.</p>

<p>The shades of the valley crept slowly up the hills
and the golden glow faded from the summits. Little
Wolf still urged the stumbling pony through the
darkness. As he rode, the frenzy that he had felt
in the war dance rushed through him. His temples
beat and his heart throbbed to the time of the snarling
drums. To him the night breeze seemed heavy
with noble deeds awaiting to be given life and voices
of thunder for the ears of men.</p>

<p>He felt that in some indefinite way he would now
become a strong <i>waschusha</i>! The Otoes had stolen
the ponies and the women; ah, that included Hinnagi!
He would save them; little did he know how,
yet he felt that he would save them. Then the
braves would not laugh at him any more, but would
let him ride to battle with them. And maybe sometime
Hinnagi would be his squaw!</p>

<p>Suddenly rounding the base of a hill, the pony
stopped short and pricked up its ears, sniffing the
wind that came up the gulch. Little Wolf, aroused
from his musing, soon understood the abruptness of
the pony. He smelled smoke! Slipping to the
ground he crawled on his hands and knees up the
gulch in the direction from which the scent of
the smoke came.</p>

<p>Soon he reached the end of the gulch and, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
into a small valley, he saw through the gloom a
number of rudely constructed tepees. Breathlessly
he listened. For awhile there was no sound except
the crackling of the low fires and the flap of the
blankets about the poles. Then as he listened, there
came to his ears a low, mournful wail as of a night
wind in the scrub oaks of a bluff.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that the Otoes slept
soundly, Little Wolf crawled in the direction of the
wail and disappeared in the gloom.</p>

<p>Some moments afterward, an Otoe brave suddenly
awoke from his heavy slumber. In the weird glow
of the falling fire he beheld at the entrance of his
tepee a grey wolf standing motionless.</p>

<p>The brave raised himself upon his elbow, uttering
a grunt of terror as of one who feels a nightmare
and would cry out were not his tongue frozen in
his mouth.</p>

<p>The wolf with a startled movement whispered
hoarsely in the Omaha tongue: “The Omahas!
They are coming! Fly! Fly!”</p>

<p>The Otoe brave leaped to his feet, every limb
growing cold with fright. He rubbed his eyes and
stared at the darkness. The wolf had vanished.</p>

<p>Now an Indian believes weird things, and the
warning of a talking wolf was not a thing to be
despised even though it were only dreamed. So the
Otoe brave gave a shout that rang up the gulch and
made the grazing ponies snort and tug at their
lariats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the entire band was rushing about the camp.</p>

<p>“The Omahas! They are coming!” cried the
startled brave. “Fly! Fly! For lo, a grey wolf
came to my tepee and spoke to me in a dream!”</p>

<p>“Fly! Fly!” echoed the whole band, delirious
with fear. “Kill the squaws!” they shouted; for in
their flight they could not be burdened with their
spoils, and they would not leave them to their
enemies.</p>

<p>There was the sound of the shrieks of women;
then the galloping of hoofs; then silence.</p>

<p>Two days afterward the Omahas, having returned
to their stricken village, made the trail of the fleeing
Otoes thunderous with pursuing hoofs. Suddenly
topping the hill that overlooked the deserted camp
of their enemies, they beheld the bodies of the slain
women strewn amid the tepees. Over one of these
a grey wolf stood.</p>

<p>There was a shout from the foremost of the
Omaha warriors, and a dozen arrows sang in the
air and quivered in the body of the wolf. It rolled
upon its side with a cry half human!</p>

<p>A group of braves, riding up to the corpse of the
woman, pulled the blanket from its face.</p>

<p>It was Hinnagi!</p>

<p>With a savage kick one turned the still quivering
body of the wolf upon its back. The grey hide fell
from an emaciated brown face, twitching with the
agony of death.</p>

<p>It was Little Wolf!</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">DREAMS ARE WISER THAN MEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">RAIN WALKER lay upon the brown grass
without the circle of the village; and it was
the time when the maize is gathered&mdash;the
brown, drear time. He lay with ear pressed to the
earth.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked one who walked
there.</p>

<p>“I?” said Rain Walker; and his eyes and face
were not good to see as he raised his head. The
dying time seemed also in his face. “The growers
are coming up, and I am listening to their breathing,”
he said.</p>

<p>And the questioner walked on with a strange
smile; for it was not the time of the coming of the
growers.</p>

<p>Rain Walker stood in the centre of the village and
held his face to the sky.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” said one who walked
there.</p>

<p>“I?” and there was twilight in Rain Walker’s
eyes as he looked upon the questioner. “I shot an
arrow into the air. It did not come back, so I am
always looking for it.”</p>

<p>And the questioner smiled and went on walking;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
for no arrow rises that does not fall. A child knows
that.</p>

<p>And the people said: “It is all because Mad
Buffalo, the Ponca, took his squaw. He took her,
and she went. It was after the summer’s feasting
and talking together that she went. Rain Walker
is not forgetting.”</p>

<p>And Rain Walker sat much alone; he sat much
alone making strange songs not pleasant to hear.
And as he made songs he made weapons. He fashioned
him a <i>man-de-hi</i>, which is a long spear, tipped
with sharp flint; and he sang. He wrought a <i>za-zi-man-di</i>,
which is a great bow; and sang all the time.
They were hate songs that he sang; they snarled.</p>

<p>He shaped many arrows; he headed them with
sharp flints and tipped them with the feathers of the
hawk; and all the time he sang. He made a <i>we-ak-ga-di</i>,
which is an ugly club. He sang to himself
and to the weapons that he made. To the harsh,
snarling airs he wrought the weapons. The songs
went into them, and they looked like things that
might hate much.</p>

<p>And one drew near who was walking. “Why do
you make war things?” said he.</p>

<p>“I?” and Rain Walker threw himself upon his
stomach, writhing toward the questioner like a big
snake. “I am a rattlesnake,” he said, “<i>hiss-ss-ss-s!</i>
go away! I sting!”</p>

<p>And the man went, for it is not good to see a man
act like a snake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>And one night the weapons were finished. All
that night the people heard the voice of Rain Walker
singing. They said: “Those are the songs of one
who wishes to go on the warpath!”</p>

<p>And in the morning Rain Walker came out of his
lodge. The squaws trembled to see him; and the
men wondered. For he had wept and his eyes were
pale. Well did the men know that he who weeps in
hate is not a child.</p>

<p>And Rain Walker raised a hoarse voice into the
morning stillness before all the people: “Where is
my woman&mdash;she who cooked for me and made my
lodge pleasant? Tell me; for I walk there that the
crows may eat me!”</p>

<p>The people shivered as though his voice were the
breath of the first frost.</p>

<p>“You need not make words, my kinsmen; I know.
I walk there and the crows shall eat me.”</p>

<p>He went forth from the door of his lodge and
came to the place where the head chief lived among
the Hungas. He raised the door flap. “A-ho!”
said he, for the chief was within eating. “I,
Rain Walker, stand before you. I have words to
give.”</p>

<p>“Speak,” said the chief.</p>

<p>“I am wronged. I wish war! I wish to see the
Poncas destroyed!”</p>

<p>The head chief gazed long into the tear-washed
eyes of Rain Walker, and he said: “It is a big thing
to take that trail. It means the wailing of women;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it means hunger; it means the crying of <i>zhinga
zhingas</i> for fathers that lie in lonesome places and
never ride back. It is a hard path to take. I will
think.”</p>

<p>And it happened after the thinking of the big chief
that a council was called&mdash;a coming-together of the
leaders of the bands.</p>

<p>And the leaders came together, and sat with big
thoughts. It was evening, and among the assembled
leaders sat Rain Walker. His face was thin and
cruel as a stone axe stained with blood.</p>

<p>Then the big chief raised his voice, and words to
be heard grew there in the big lodge. “This man
who sits with us has been wronged. When our
brothers, the Poncas, were among us for the feasting
and the talking together, Mad Buffalo was among
them.</p>

<p>“A woman is a thing not to be understood. Now
she dies on long winter trails for a man, or grows
old and wrinkled suckling his <i>zhinga zhingas</i>; and
now she leaves him for another; yet it is the same
woman. I knew a wise man once; but he shook his
head about these things; and so do I.</p>

<p>“You know of whom I speak. It was Sun Eyes;
and she was this man’s woman. Mad Buffalo smiled,
and she went with him.”</p>

<p>Rain Walker’s breath, that hissed through his
teeth, filled up the silence that followed. His face
was thin and sharp and eager, even as the barbed
head of a war arrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“And this man has come to me crying for war,”
continued the head chief. “Think hard, and let us
talk together.”</p>

<p>And he of the Big Elk band said: “Let the
Poncas come down in the night and drive away our
ponies, and I will gather my band about me. But
it has not been so.”</p>

<p>And he of the Hawk band said: “Let the
Poncas destroy our gardens, and I will think of my
weapons.”</p>

<p>And he of the No-Teeth band said: “Let the
Poncas speak ill of us, and my band will put on the
war paint.”</p>

<p>Then a silence grew and the head chief filled it
with few words. “Let us pass the pipe; and all
who smoke it smoke for war.”</p>

<p>And there were ten chiefs in the council, sitting
in a circle. The first touched the pipe lightly and
passed it on as though it burned his fingers; and so
the second and third, even to the tenth. And next
to him sat Rain Walker. His breath came drily
through his teeth, like a hot wind in a parched gulch.
With hands that trembled he grasped the pipe from
the tenth, who had not placed it to his lips. Rain
Walker placed it to his lips nervously, eagerly, as
one who touches a cool water bowl after a long
thirst. He struck a flint and lit it. Then he arose
to his feet, tall, straight, trembling&mdash;a Rage grown
into a man!</p>

<p>“<i>I smoke!</i>” he cried; “I smoke, and through all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the sunlights that come I shall walk alone and kill!
The lonesome walker&mdash;I am he!</p>

<p>“I shall speak to the snake, and he shall teach me
his creeping and his stinging. I shall speak to the
elk, and he shall teach me his fleetness, his strength
that lasts, his fury when he turns to fight. And I
shall speak to the hawk and learn the keenness of his
eyes!”</p>

<p>Rain Walker puffed blue streamers of smoke into
the still twilight of the lodge, seeming something
more than man in the fog he made.</p>

<p>“I smoke!” he cried; and his cry had changed
into a song of snarling sounds and sounds that wailed.
“I smoke, and I smoke alone; my brothers will not
take the pipe with me. In lonesome places shall I
walk with my hate, and not even the lone hawk in
the furthest hills shall hear me make aught but a
hate cry. I have no longer any people! I am a
tribe&mdash;the tribe that walks alone! The <i>zhinga
zhingas</i> of the women that are not yet born shall
hear my name, and it shall be like a nightwind wailing
when the spirits walk and the fires are blue! I
will forget that I am the son of a woman; I will
think myself the son of a snake, that bore me on
a hot rock in a lonesome place. I will think that I
never tasted woman’s milk, but only venom stewed
by the hot sun. And now I walk alone.”</p>

<p>His cry had fallen to a low wail that made the
flesh of the hearers creep, although they were leaders
and brave. And with eyes that peered far ahead as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
into impenetrable distances Rain Walker strode out
of the lodge. The night was coming; he went forth
to meet it, walking.</p>

<p>As he walked toward the night his thoughts were
of <i>choobay</i> (holy) things. He thought much of the
spirits, and he reached a high hill as he walked. It
was high; therefore it was a <i>choobay</i> place. And he
climbed to the summit, bare of grass and white with
flaked rocks against the sky, that darkened fast as
the Night walked.</p>

<p>Then he lit his pipe and made <i>choobay</i> smoke.
He wished to have the good <i>wakundas</i> with him,
even though he walked alone. For well he knew
that no man can walk quite alone. So he extended
the pipe stem to the west, the south, the east, the
north, and he cried, “O you who cause the four
winds to reach a place, help me! I stand needy!”
Then he extended the pipe stem toward the earth,
and he said, “O Venerable Man who lives at the
bottom, here I stand needy!” And to the heavens
he held the stem and cried, “O Grandfather who
lives above, I stand needy; I, Rain Walker! Though
my brothers treat me badly, yet I think you will
help me!”</p>

<p>And he felt much stronger.</p>

<p>Then, with his weapons about him, he set his face
to the south, for there in the flat lands of Nebraska
lay the village of the Poncas.</p>

<p>And he walked in lonesome places all night. A
coyote trotted past him and sat at some distance.
“O brother Coyote,” said Rain Walker, “I am on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the warpath; teach me your long running and your
snapping!” The coyote whined and went into a
gulch.</p>

<p>“I walk alone, and none relieve my sorrow!”</p>

<p>So sang Rain Walker; and singing thus he walked
into the morning. And the prairie was grey with
frost and very big, and the skies were filled with a
quiet, so that a far crow cawing faintly made a shout.
Having nothing to eat he sang, and hunger went
away. His song filled the world, for he walked
alone where it was very silent.</p>

<p>To the hawk he cried for keenness of eyes; but
the hawk circled on and was only a speck. Nothing
heard the man who walked alone.</p>

<p>He killed a rabbit and ate; he found a stream and
drank. Then he met the Night walking again, and
they walked together until they met the Day; and the
man saw below him in the flat lands of Nebraska the
jumbled mud village of the Poncas.</p>

<p>And it happened that the people in the village
were moving very early. There was a neighing of
ponies and a shouting of men and a scolding and
laughing of women. It was the time of the bison
hunt, and they were going forth that day.</p>

<p>Rain Walker lay in the brown grass at the hilltop
and watched with wistful eyes the merry ones as the
long, thin file left the village, the riders and the
walkers and the drags. It is pleasant to go on
the hunt. Rain Walker felt that he would never
go again.</p>

<p>His face softened; then suddenly it changed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
became again as a barbed war arrow. Mad Buffalo
rode, and after him went Sun Eyes walking! Her
head hung low like a thing wilted by the frost. She
laughed none; she, too, seemed as one who walked
alone.</p>

<p>When the long, thin line, like a huge snake writhing
westward into the hills, had disappeared, Rain
Walker got up and walked fast. He walked fast,
for he wished to be near the place of camping when
the night came. And it was so.</p>

<p>He lay at a distance, watching the fires flare into
the night and feeling very hungry, for he caught the
scent of the boiling kettles. They smelled like home.
And when the people had eaten and the fires had
fallen, Rain Walker said, “Now I will begin my
war. I need a pony, the Poncas have them.”</p>

<p>He crawled upon his hands and knees to where the
herd grazed. There had been no watch set, for all
the tribes were at peace, except the tribe that walked
alone.</p>

<p>And Rain Walker rode away into the night. He
had big thoughts as he rode.</p>

<p>The hunting was poor that year; it happened so,
they say. Still toward the place where the evening
goes went the tribe, peering into far places for the
bison; and ever there was one who crept near the
tepees at night and heard the words of the Poncas,
which are the same as the Omahas speak.</p>

<p>And they wandered, hunting, in the places where
the sandhills are&mdash;the dreary places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>And one day it happened, they say, that a coyote
and a hawk and some crows saw two men in a very
lonesome place among the sand hills. They alone
saw. And the two met, riding. One was a Ponca
gone forth to seek the unappearing herd. He was
tall and well made, and his pony was spotted. The
other was also even as the first, although not a
Ponca; but his pony was not spotted.</p>

<p>And when they met a great cry went up from the
one whose pony was not spotted. The coyote and the
hawk and the crows heard and saw. It seemed a
strange cry in the silence that lived there. Then he
who rode the spotted pony turned and fled; but an
arrow is swifter than a pony, though it be wind-footed;
and he who fled fell upon the sand and the
pony ran at some distance and stopped. He looked
on also.</p>

<p>And the two men met. He with the arrow in his
back arose with a groan from the sand and growled
as the other approached and dismounted. They
seemed as two who had met and parted enemies.</p>

<p>They seized each other and rolled upon the sand.
The coyote whined, the crows cawed, but the
hawk only watched. But all the while the ponies
neighed.</p>

<p>And the sting of the arrow weakened one, but he
fought like a bear. He made a good fight. But the
other fixed his hands upon his enemy’s throat until the
silent places were filled with a gurgling and a rasping
of breath that came hard. Then there was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
silence. The coyote ran away, the crows and the
hawk flew. The ponies alone watched now.</p>

<p>And the man whose pony was not spotted arose
and laughed very loud&mdash;only it was not the laugh of
a glad man. Then the man who laughed stripped off
the garments of the other and put them upon himself.
Then he built a fire and lit his pipe and made
<i>choobay</i> smoke. Then he spoke to the various <i>wakundas</i>
that were somewhere there in the silence.</p>

<p>“I have killed my enemy. I will burn his heart
and give you the ashes, O Grandfathers!”</p>

<p>The crows heard this, for they had come back
looking for their feast.</p>

<p>And the man burned the heart of his enemy and
scattered the ashes, singing a brave song all the
while. He had learned to do this from the Kansas;
it is their custom.</p>

<p>Then the man got on the spotted pony and rode
away, bearing with him the weapons of the man who
stayed. And when he was gone the crows and the
coyote came and made harsh noises at each other, for
each was hungry, and there was a feast spread there
upon the sand.</p>

<p class="p2">And it happened that evening, they say, that one
rode into the Ponca camp and went to the tepee
where Sun Eyes, the Omaha woman, waited for
someone.</p>

<p>The man who came had his whole face hidden
with a piece of buckskin, having eye and mouth holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in it. And Sun Eyes was cooking over a fire before
her tepee.</p>

<p>“Ho, Mad Buffalo!” she said; “you have not
found the bison. Why have you hidden your face?”</p>

<p>“I found no bison,” said the man, “but I saw
something in the hills which caused me to hide my
face.”</p>

<p>And Sun Eyes looked keenly at the man, for she
thought it was some <i>wakunda</i> he had seen.</p>

<p>“Why do you speak in a strange voice?” said
she; and she trembled as she said it.</p>

<p>“He who has seen something is never the same
again!” said he.</p>

<p>And while the woman wondered the two ate
together. And as the man ate he laughed very pleasantly
at times like a man who is very glad.</p>

<p>“Why do you laugh, Mad Buffalo?” said the
woman.</p>

<p>“Because I was very hungry for something, and
I have it now,” said the man.</p>

<p>And when he had ceased eating he sang glad
songs, and again the woman questioned.</p>

<p>“I sing because of what I saw in the hills,”
said he.</p>

<p>And this seemed very strange to the woman. But
it is not allowed that one should question a man who
has seen a <i>wakunda</i>.</p>

<p>And it happened that the man was pleased to
speak evil words of Rain Walker, and Sun Eyes
hung her head; her eyes were wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said the man, having seen: “Why do you
act so? Do you want him? Behold! Am I not as
good to see as Rain Walker?”</p>

<p>And he acted as one who is almost angry and a
little sad. But the woman only sobbed a very little
sob, for as the chief said in the council, a very wise
man does not know the ways of a woman.</p>

<p>And it happened that night, they say, that, as the
two slept, Sun Eyes dreamed a strange dream that
made her cry out. And the two sat up startled.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said the man.</p>

<p>“A dream!” sobbed Sun Eyes.</p>

<p>“What dream?” said the man, and his voice
seemed kind.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell; I do not wish to be beaten.”</p>

<p>“Tell it, Sun Eyes. Was it about&mdash;Rain
Walker?”</p>

<p>She did not answer; the man sighed.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid,” he said. And she spoke.</p>

<p>“I dreamed that I saw my <i>zhinga zhinga</i> that I
am carrying. And it was Rain Walker’s. It had
his face, and it looked upon me with hate. It pushed
me away when I offered my breast. It would take
no milk from me. And it seemed that its look
pierced me like a barbed arrow. Thus I awoke, and
cried out.”</p>

<p>The woman was sobbing, and a tremor ran
through the man. She felt it as he leaned against
her, and she thought it anger.</p>

<p>“Take me there where I came from&mdash;to the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of my people!” she cried. “You are big and
good to see, and many women will follow you!
Take me to my people! Dreams are wiser than men;
the <i>wakundas</i> send them. I wish to go back, that
my child may smile and take my breast.”</p>

<p>And the man rose and began dressing for the trail.</p>

<p>“I will take you back,” said he. “Dreams are
wiser than men.”</p>

<p>And before the day walked the two went forth
on the long trail, back to the village of the woman’s
people.</p>

<p>The man went before and the woman followed,
bearing the burdens of the trail. But when the dawn
came the man did a strange thing. He took the burdens
upon his own shoulders, saying nothing. It
seemed his heart had been softened; but his face
being hidden, the woman could not see what was
written there.</p>

<p>And the trail was long; but the man was kind. He
seemed no longer the Mad Buffalo. He made fires
and pitched the tepee like a squaw. He spoke soft
words.</p>

<p>And after many days of travelling the two came,
as the Night was beginning to walk, to the brown
brow of the hill beneath which lay the village of the
Omahas.</p>

<p>And the man said: “There are your people.
Go!”</p>

<p>And the woman moaned, saying: “He will not
take me, and the dream will be true. Never on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
long trail did my heart fail; but now I am weak.
My breast aches.”</p>

<p>But the man said: “Sun Eyes, had not Rain
Walker ever a soft heart? He will take you back.
Look!”</p>

<p>And the woman, who had been gazing through
tears upon the village of her people, turned and saw
that the man had torn the buckskin from his face.
She gave a cry and shrank from what she saw.</p>

<p>But the man took her gently by the hand.</p>

<p>“He will take you back,” he said; “dreams are
wiser than men!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SMILE OF GOD</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE Omahas were hunting bison. The
young moon had been thin and bent like a
bow by the arm of a strong man when they
had left their village in the valley of Ne Shuga.
Night after night it had grown above their cheerless
tepees, ever further eastward, until now it came
forth no more, but lingered in its black lodge like a
brave who has walked far and keeps his blankets
because the way was hard and long.</p>

<p>All through the time of the growing and dying
moon, the Omahas had sought for the bison. Upon
a hundred summits they had halted to gaze beneath
the arched hand into the lonely valleys from whence
came no sound of lowing cows or bellowing bulls.
Like the voice of Famine through the lonesome air
came the <i>caw-caw</i> of the crow. Like heaps of bleaching
bones the far-off sage brush whitened.</p>

<p>This evening as the women busied themselves with
the building of the tepees, there was no crooning on
their lips. The valley in which they were placing
their camp was still but for the clattering of the poles,
as they were placed in their conical positions, or the
flap of the blankets, which were being bound about
the poles for a covering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>At dreary intervals a grazing pony would toss its
weary head and neigh nervously, as if wondering at
the stillness of its masters.</p>

<p>The silent squaws gathered armfuls of scrub oak
and plum twigs, and lit fires that lapped the blackening
air with ruddy tongues and sent their voices
roaring up the hills, to be answered by their echoes
that came back faintly like the lowing of a phantom
herd!</p>

<p>The old men and the braves sat about the fires
and no word was on their lips. From lip to lip the
fragrant pipe passed, yet even its softening influence
could not move to speech the lips it touched. Each
face upon which the firelight fell was hideous with
the gauntness of hunger.</p>

<p>One by one the runners, sent out in search of the
herds, came into camp. With a slow, swinging trot
these great lean men approached, as the gaunt wolf
approaches his lair in the cold light of the morning
when no prey has been abroad all night. Sullen and
silent they took their places in the cheerless circles
about the fires. There was no need for words from
them. Their expectant kinsmen looked into their
faces and read the tale of their despair so readily
from the drawn skin and sunken eyes that they
groaned.</p>

<p>The glow of the west fell into the greyness of
ashes, as a camp fire falls when all the women sleep.
Then the dark came over the eastern hills. Far into
the night the braves and old men sat about the fires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
speechless. As they listened, they could hear the
hungry children whining in their sleep. Once a
squaw, suddenly awakened from a dream near the
fires, leaped to her feet and cried “<i>Tae!</i> <i>Tae!</i>
[bison]” The hoarse cry beat against the black
hills and came back like a mockery. The men gazed
at each other and grinned with twitching lips.</p>

<p>Again the lonesome air slumbered, save for a
weird song that arose from the tepee of the big
medicine-man, Ashunhunga. He was calling to
Wakunda. The song droned itself into silence like
the song of a locust when the evening is quiet.</p>

<p>After some time, a sound of wailing came from
the mysterious tepee; and as the men turned their
faces to the place, they beheld the half-naked form
of the medicine-man passing like a spectre amid the
glow of the fires.</p>

<p>The dry skin clung to his ribs and sinews. His
head was thrown back and the fires lit his face.
Through his parted lips the white teeth shone. Out
of the hollows of his eyes a wild light glared. The
dream was upon him! With bony hands clenched,
he beat his naked breast and cried: “<i>Wah-hoo-ha-a!</i>
<i>Wah-hoo-ha-a-a-a!</i> The curse of Wakunda is upon
us! The black spirits of the dead are about us! For
Ashunhunga had a dream. A black spirit came to
him and its eyes were lightning and its voice was
thunder as it said: ‘Why do you shelter him whom
Wakunda hates?’ <i>Wa-hoo-ha-a-a-a!</i>”</p>

<p>Blood fell from the mysterious man’s palms where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the nails clenched convulsively, and his arms and
breast were smeared with blood. The listeners shuddered
as the wild voice began anew.</p>

<p>“Ashunhunga will talk to the black spirit! He
will learn whom Wakunda hates! Him we shall cast
from us! Then Wakunda will smile and the valleys
shall thunder with herds!”</p>

<p>Beating his breast and gesticulating wildly with his
long, bony arms, the old man passed back amid the
tepees.</p>

<p>Those who sat about the fires were frozen by the
wild words into bronze statues of Fear. Scarcely
was a breath drawn; not a man moved. The black
spirits of the dead were about them! Not a hand
was raised to replenish the fires with faggots. The
flames sank, and the embers sent a dull blue light
upon the circles of haggard faces!</p>

<p>As Ashunhunga passed on toward his tepee, he
suddenly stumbled over a shivering form, huddled
in the shadow. Quickly regaining his feet, he saw
that upon which he had stumbled. It was a dwarfed,
ill-shapen body, with short, crooked legs and long
emaciated arms with protruding joints. The form
raised itself upon its hands and knees and looked
upon the medicine-man with an idiot leer upon its
face.</p>

<p>It was Shanugahi (Nettle) the cripple.</p>

<p>With a cry as of a squaw who sees a black spirit in
her sleep, Ashunhunga rushed into his tepee. His
mystical songs wailed over the camp for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
then ceased. Overcome by his fanatical emotions,
he had fallen into a swoon. And he had a dream.</p>

<p>He was alone upon the prairie and hunger was
pinching his entrails. Then there came a bison bull
toward him, roaring through the silence. He raised
his bow, and with sure aim, sent an arrow singing
into the heart of the beast. Then the air grew black,
save for a blue light as of dying fires. The bison
began to change form! Its hind legs grew short and
crooked; its fore legs became long and lean and
sinewy like the arms of a starving man. Its body
dwindled, dwindled&mdash;and it was human! Its head
became indistinct and wavered as in a haze. Then
it grew boldly up in the ghastly light and the face
was the face of Shanugahi with the idiot leer!</p>

<p>The vision whirled giddily and sank into the dizzy
darkness.</p>

<p>With a cry as of one stabbed in his sleep, Ashunhunga
sprang from his blanket and rushed out of his
tepee. Those who sat about the smouldering fires,
startled from their dumb terror by the cry, raised
their eyes and gazed upon the face of the medicine-man
as he passed. They did not speak, but the question
on their faces was “who?”</p>

<p>“It is Shanugahi!” said Ashunhunga in an awing
whisper. “It is Shanugahi whom Wakunda hates!
He has brought the curse upon us!”</p>

<p>The ill-shapen bronze mass of flesh that was Shanugahi
lay curled up in sleep in the shadow of a
tepee. Suddenly his sleep was broken by a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hand reaching out of the darkness. He shook himself,
raised his head and gazed about. He saw the
faces of a number of braves indistinct in the dim
glow of the fires. Nearby a pony stood ready for a
rider. Then a strange voice close to his ear, whispered
hoarsely: “Fly! Fly! The black spirits of
the dead are about you! The curse of Wakunda is
upon you! Fly! Fly!”</p>

<p>Shanugahi stared about him, then turned his meaningless
eyes upon his tribesmen and leered. Strong
arms seized him and placed him astride the waiting
pony. Someone lashed the animal across the
haunches, and it plunged down the valley into the
blackness of the night.</p>

<p>When the dazed rider had gone some distance, the
meaning of the whispered words came upon him.
Cold sweat sprang out on his limbs. He glanced
about him, and the night was swarming with demons!</p>

<p>His shriek cut the stillness like a knife of ice! He
grasped the mane of the pony with a convulsive clasp.
He dashed his heels into the flanks of the terrified
brute! The lone gulches thundered with the beat of
hoofs. Bushes flew past, and each was a pursuing
black spirit!</p>

<p>Shanugahi clung closely to the pony’s back, hiding
his face in its tossing mane, clasping its neck with
the strength of madness, pressing its ribs with his
knees until the straining animal groaned with pain
and fright. Through valleys, over hills, down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
gulches they fled! Clumps of sage brush flitted past,
and each was a heap of whitened bones!</p>

<p>It was like falling in a nightmare through an immeasurable
black pit, save for the scamper of the
coyote as it sought the gulches, whining, or the
tumbling flight of the owl or bat, fleeing with
wings that whirred in the stillness!</p>

<p>The pace of the pony became slower and slower.
Its breath came in short, rasping gasps. Then with
a last effort of its terrified limbs, it took the long
incline of a high hill, and upon the bare summit
tumbled to its knees. Shanugahi rolled off its back,
and horse and rider, worn out, swooned upon the
summit.</p>

<p>When Shanugahi awoke, the pale light that foregoes
the coming sun lay upon the shivering hills.
He looked about him and saw a circle of grey wolves
staring at him with eyes like small moons dawnstricken.
He felt about him for a weapon, but found
only his stone pipe and a pouch of red willow bark.</p>

<p>He filled his pipe and striking a spark from a bit
of flint that strewed the summit, he lit it. Then the
sun peeped over the far sky line and with its horizontal
rays touched the hills with fire. Its light
warmed the frozen nerves of Shanugahi. He puffed
grey rings of smoke into the air.</p>

<p>At length, taking his pipe from his mouth, he
reared his hideous body in the glow of the morning,
and with a long, bony arm, raised his pipe to the
smiling sun in silent invocation. For some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
motionless, he stood like a being of the black depths
praying for mercy from the shining heights. Then
he uttered two words.</p>

<p>“<i>Wakunda! Tae!</i>” (O God! Bison!)</p>

<p>The staring wolves, moved by the wild voice,
raised their noses to the heavens with a howl, and
slunk away into the gulches. The sun rose higher
and higher, and Shanugahi breathed into his veins
the laughing gold of the morning. With all the
simplicity of his nature, he forgot the terror of the
night. It was to him as some vague dream, dreamed
many summers past. Yet the one fixed idea of finding
the bison swayed his whole being.</p>

<p>His hunger had reached that stage in which it
acts like a heavy draught of some subtle intoxicant.
The stupor of days past had been changed into a
joyous and even hopeful delirium. And as he looked
upon the sun, to him it was the smile of Wakunda!
Now he would find the bison.</p>

<p>He caught his pony, grazing near by, and leaping
upon its back, urged its stiffened limbs into a jog and
took the lonesome stretch of prairie with song upon
his lips. All day the pony jogged across the prairie
at an easy pace toward the west. At that time of the
evening when the coolness comes with the dew, and
the bugs awake with drowsy hummings among the
grasses, Shanugahi caught a roaring sound as of some
sullen storm that thunders beneath the horizon.</p>

<p>He checked his pony and placing his hands to his
ears, listened intently. He knew the sound! Dismounting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
he crawled to the top of a hill and gazed
into a broad valley.</p>

<p>As far as he could see, straining his eyes, the valley
was black with bison! For a moment he stood spellbound;
then a great joy lashed his blood into a
frenzy. He rushed to his pony and mounting,
turned its head to the east. The night came down,
and still Shanugahi held his pony to a fast gallop.
His brain whirled giddily. Now he had found the
bison! His people would not starve. He sang and
shouted and laughed until his voice broke into a
cackle! The delirium of the rider was caught by
the pony. With all the might of long generations
of prairie herds, it sent the thundering hills and
valleys under its feet.</p>

<p>At that time of the morning when the east grows
pale, and sleep is the deepest, the famished tribe,
having moved a weary day’s journey westward, was
sleeping heavily. Suddenly a hoarse shout shattered
their dreams and made the hills clamorous with
echoes!</p>

<p>The whole camp leaped from its blankets and
stared with blinking eyes in the direction of the
shout.</p>

<p>There, upon the brow of a hill that overlooked
the camp, stood a horse and rider set in bold relief
against the pale sky of morning. With a long, bony
arm the rider pointed to the westward and again he
cried in a weak, broken voice:</p>

<p>“<i>Tae! Tae!</i>” (Bison! bison!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Then horse and rider collapsed like the figures of
a dream that wavers with the morning. A number
of men rushing up the hill, found the bodies of the
pony and Shanugahi. Upon the lips of the dead
rider lingered a calm smile as of contentment.</p>

<p>“It is the smile of Wakunda,” said one old man
in awe.</p>

<p>“Wakunda smiles! Wakunda smiles!” shouted
the men. The whole camp caught up the cry.
“Bison! Bison! Wakunda smiles!”</p>

<p>And when the sun arose, they were moving westward
on the trail of Shanugahi.</p>

<p class="p2">Two nights afterward there was joy in the camp
of the Omahas. Having found the long-sought-for
herd, they had feasted heavily, and now they slept
as the wolf sleeps when the prey has not escaped.
Beside a fire two old men were still awake, and as
they smoked, they talked of Shanugahi. He had
found the herd. Wakunda had smiled upon him;
and yet Shanugahi was ugly and a cripple!</p>

<p>“Ugh!” they both grunted after a thoughtful
silence, shaking their heads in wonderment at so incomprehensible
a thing.</p>

<p>Then they wrapped themselves in their blankets,
and slept.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HEART OF A WOMAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE council of the fathers sat in the Big
Lodge with very grave faces, for they had
come together to pass judgment upon the
deed of a woman. As they passed the pipe about
the circle, there were no words; for in the silence
the good spirits may speak, and well they knew that it
is a big thing to sit in judgment.</p>

<p>And after a time of silence and deep thought, the
door-flap of the lodge was pushed aside by two who
came&mdash;an old man bent with many loads, and a
woman in whose eyes the spring still lived. And
when the two had sat down without the circle, the
head chief spoke: “Let the man speak first.” Then
the old man, who had brought the woman, arose.</p>

<p>“Fathers, you see a man with a sad heart, for I
have brought my daughter before you for judgment.
The things which she has told me I could have buried
very deep in my breast; but I am old, and the wisdom
of the old is mine. Who can bury a bad thing
deeper than the spirits see?</p>

<p>“And so I am here to make sharp words against
myself, for the father and the child are one.</p>

<p>“You remember that the season of singing frogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
[April] has passed three times since one of the palefaces
came among us. He was a paleface, but he
was not like his brothers who find gladness in doing
deeds that are bad. You have not forgotten how
his words and deeds were kind, his voice very good
to hear, nor how his face had the beauty of a
woman’s, though it was not a woman’s face. Also
his hands were white as the first snow fallen on a green
place; and his hair was long like the hair of our
people, but it clung about his head like a brown cloud
when the evening is old.</p>

<p>“He was hungry and lean when he came among
us. His pony was hungry and lean. And we took
him in with glad hearts; we lit the feast fires for
him; his pony we staked in our greenest places: for
he was not like his brothers.</p>

<p>“And we called him ‘the man with the singing
box,’ for he brought with him a thing of wood and
sinews; and over this, while we feasted, he drew a
stick of wood with the hair of a pony’s tail fastened
to it, making songs sweeter than those of our best
women singers, and deeper than the voices of men
who are glad.</p>

<p>“Much we wondered at this, for the magic of
the paleface is a great magic. And as he made the
wood and sinews sing together, we forgot to eat and
the feast fires fell blue; for never before had such a
singing been heard in our lands. And once he made
it sing a battle song that snarled like a wounded
rattlesnake in a dry place, and cried like an angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
warrior, and shrieked like arrows, and thundered
like many pony hoofs, and wailed like the women
when the band comes back with dead braves across
the backs of ponies. And as he made it sing this
song, even we who were wise leaped to our feet and
drew forth our weapons and shouted the war cry
of our people&mdash;so great was the song. And when
our shouting ceased, the man made the medicine box
sing low and sweet and thin like a woman crying
over a sick <i>zhinga zhinga</i> [baby] in the night. And
we forgot the battle cries; we gave tears like old
women.</p>

<p>“Do you remember? This is the man of whom
I speak.</p>

<p>“Many young moons grew old and passed away,
and still he lived among us, until, lo! he was even
as our kinsman, for he learned the tongue of our
people, being great of wit.</p>

<p>“And he told us of a wanderer whose own people
were unkind to him; a tale of one who was not of
the people of whom he was born, because he loved
the spirits that sing, more than a very rich man loves
his herds of ponies blackening many hills where they
graze. And it was of himself he told; he was the
wanderer. So we loved him because of this and because
of his kind words and because of the song
which he made in his medicine box.</p>

<p>“And all the while my girl here was growing
taller&mdash;very good to see. Many times I said to my
woman, ‘There is something growing between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
two.’ And we both saw it with glad hearts, for he
was a great man.</p>

<p>“And one night in my first sleep I was awakened
by a crying of sorrows better to hear than laughter&mdash;a
moan that grew loud and fell again into softness
like a night wind wailing in a lonesome place where
thickets grow. And my woman beside me whispered,
‘It is the spirits singing.’ But the girl here only
breathed very hard. I could hear her breathing in
the darkness.</p>

<p>“And I got up; I pushed the skin flap aside; I
stood as though I were in a dream. For there by
the tepee stood the man with the singing box at his
neck. His long, white fingers worked upon the
sinews; his arm drew the hair-stick up and down.
His face looked to the sky and the white fires of the
night were upon it. Never had I seen such a face;
for it was not a man’s face nor yet a woman’s. It
was the face of a good man’s spirit come back from
the star-paths. I looked at his lips, for it seemed
that the singing grew up from his mouth; but his
lips were very still.</p>

<p>“And my eyes made tears; for many forgotten
sorrows came back to me at once, and I felt a great
kindness for all things, which I could not understand.</p>

<p>“And when he dropped his arm and looked at
me, his eyes threw soft, white fire into my breast,
and then I knew the singing was not for me. Once
when my woman was young and still in the lodge of
her father, I looked upon her with such a look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I gave the girl to the paleface; and for a
time the singing box was still; for they made a silent
music between them. And before the first frosts
made the hills shiver, the palefaces who trade for
furs came to our village, and the man went with
them; and with him went the woman. No man can
be deaf to the call of his kind; so he went. And now
the woman shall speak, and you shall judge her
deed.”</p>

<p>The old man sat down and rested his face in his
hands. The young woman arose to her feet. With
lips parted the chiefs bent forward to catch the
words which should fall from her mouth. Tall and
thin she was, and shapely. But the shadows of a
great toil and a great sorrow clung about her lean
cheeks and under her black eyes, grown too big with
much weeping.</p>

<p>“Fathers,” she began, “I will tell you how my
bad deed grew upon me; and you shall judge. I will
take the punishment, for I have felt much aching
of the breast and I can stand yet a little more.</p>

<p>“Three summers ago I followed the man of the
singing box into the North. This you know&mdash;but
the rest you do not know. It is the way of the paleface
to toil for the white metal. They showed my
man the white metal, and it led him into the North
among strange peoples, where there is much gathering
of furs. And I went with him, for a woman is
weak and must follow the man.</p>

<p>“Far into the North we went where the Smoky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Water runs thin so that a very little man can
throw a stone across it. And the singing box went
with us.</p>

<p>“And we built a lodge of logs, after the manner
of his people, near to a great log lodge where the
big pale chief lived and said words that should be
obeyed. And for a time our hearts sang together.
But when the snows had come, it happened that the
big pale chief spoke a word, and my man went with
his brothers, driving many dogs further into the
North where there are furs of much worth.</p>

<p>“And when my man left he said, ‘Take good care
of Vylin while I am gone, for she is dearer to me
than my life.’ And I stared at him because I did not
understand. It was the singing box of which he
spoke; as though it were a person he spoke of it; he
called it Vylin; and much I wondered.</p>

<p>“But because my heart was warm toward the man,
I did acts of kindness to the singing box, which he
called Vylin; for I had not yet learned that it was
no box of wood, but the spirit of a dead woman of
the palefaces.</p>

<p>“Through the long cold nights I held it close to
me under the blankets. And often in the night I
was awakened by its crying when in my sleep I
touched it strongly. Like a <i>zhinga zhinga</i> [baby]
it cried; and my heart was softened toward it, for
I had no child then. Through the days I talked to
Vylin. I washed it much that it might be clean and
of a good smell. And often it made soft sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
like a <i>zhinga zhinga</i> that is glad. Then would I
hold it to my dry breasts and sing to it.</p>

<p>“But more and more I learned that it was no
box of wood, but a living thing. For I began to
see that it had the shape of a woman. Its neck was
very slender; its head was small; and its hair fell in
four little braids across its neck and breast down to
its hips. And the more I learned, the more my breast
ached; for he loved Vylin, and her voice was sweeter
for singing than my voice. And I thought much of
how she sang for him alone. And I said, ‘She does
not sing for me&mdash;only for him does she sing; therefore
she loves him well.’</p>

<p>“When the grass came again and the ice broke
up, my man came back with the furs and the dogs
and the men. They came floating down the river
on big canoes. And I sang when he came again into
his lodge, for the winter had been long. Also, I
showed him how kind I had been to Vylin; I thought
he would be very glad. But he frowned and spoke
sharp words. He said it was wrong to wash Vylin.
My breast ached; I could not understand. Does not
a good mother wash her <i>zhinga zhinga</i>, that it may
be clean and of a good smell? I had no <i>zhinga
zhinga</i> then, and so I had been a mother to Vylin.</p>

<p>“And when I told him this, he laughed a very
harsh laugh, and said it was Vylin, not a <i>zhinga
zhinga</i>; so that I was sad until he spoke a very soft
word, then I forgot for many days.</p>

<p>“But as the grass grew taller and the scent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
green things blew in every wind, my man grew
strange toward me. Like a man with the ache for
home he was. And more and more it became his
mood to be very silent while he made Vylin sing to
him&mdash;O such strange, soft songs, like spirits weeping!</p>

<p>“And more and more my heart grew sore toward
Vylin, for when I sang that he might forget her to
look upon me, he frowned and spoke sharp words.</p>

<p>“So one day as he sat in a shady place, making
songs with his fingers, I said to him: ‘If so softly
you should lay your fingers upon <i>my</i> neck, I too could
sing as sweetly!’ And he smiled, and it was like
the sun breaking through a cloud that has hung long
over the day. And he drew me close to him and said:
‘Do you see the leaves upon this tree, and do you
know how many?’ And I laughed, for I was glad,
and in the old days it had often been his wish to
joke so. But he said: ‘So many of the palefaces
have listened to me making Vylin sing; and they
wept to hear. But now am I far away and strange
peoples are about me.’</p>

<p>“And that was the last of my gladness for many
moons; for more and more he wished to be silent.
And when the snows came again he went away. And
I was very lonesome and sad until I knew that I
would be a mother. Then my heart sang, for I
said: ‘Now, my man will look upon me again and
speak soft words as in the old times. Does Vylin
bring him <i>zhinga zhingas?</i>’</p>

<p>“And all through the cold days I was glad; my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
heart was soft. I took good care of Vylin; I was
kind to her, for at last I thought that she would be
second in his heart. I pitied her as I thought this.
I washed her no more, but ever through the frosty
nights I kept her warm with many blankets, even
though I shivered.</p>

<p>“And when the grass came my man came also.
And another came, a <i>nu zhinga</i> [boy]. But my
man looked with cold eyes upon my <i>zhinga zhinga</i>;
so I wept many nights, many, many nights. And
much weeping made me not good to see. So the
man looked upon me no more; only upon Vylin did
he look. With very soft eyes did he look upon her;
with such eyes did he look upon me in the old days.</p>

<p>“My heart grew very bitter. Often I heard him
talking soft talk to her&mdash;such as he talked to me in
the old times. And I wished to tear her hair, her
yellow hair from her head! I wished to kill her, to
walk upon her, to hear her groan, to see her die!”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes flashed a battle light. Her
hands were clenched, her face was sharp and cruel.
Very tall she grew in her anger&mdash;a mother of
fighting men.</p>

<p>“And that night,” she said, “I threw angry
words at the man. I spoke bad things of Vylin. I
called great curses down upon her. And I said:
‘She sings, but does she bring you sons to feed you
when you are old?’ And he laughed with a harsh
sound.</p>

<p>“So that night when the man slept I got up very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
stealthily from the blankets. My breast ached, and
many black spirits pressed their fingers into my heart.
I took a knife&mdash;a very sharp knife. I uncovered
Vylin where she lay sleeping in her blankets. I felt
for the place where her heart should be. Then I
struck, struck, struck! Very deep I sent the sharp
knife, and I laughed to hear the great groan that
Vylin made as she died.</p>

<p>“And also the man heard. He leaped from his
blankets. He struck me with his fist; he beat me.
He called down all the big curses of his people upon
me. He gave me the <i>nu zhinga</i>. He pushed me
from the door into the darkness.</p>

<p>“‘Begone!’ he said, ‘for you have killed Vylin!’</p>

<p>“And I went into the darkness with my <i>nu zhinga</i>.
Many days have I walked with much hunger; and
always the <i>nu zhinga</i> was a heavy burden. And now
I am thin; my feet are weary; my breast aches.”</p>

<p class="p2">A deep sighing shook the young woman as she
sat down. The old man arose, and there was a
sound of heavy breathing as he spoke to the chiefs
who sat to judge: “My girl has spoken of her bad
deed. She has killed the singing spirit that the paleface
loved. How shall she be punished?”</p>

<p>And after a long stillness the head chief spoke:
“The heart of a woman is a strange thing, a tender
thing; who shall judge it?”</p>

<p>And one by one they who sat to judge arose and
left the big lodge.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">“BUT, Yellow Fox,” I protested, “no one
understands them; they do not understand
themselves!”</p>

<p>Yellow Fox grunted and smiled, showing a very
white set of wolfish teeth. We two were sitting
together outside the lodge, and, male-like, we had
hit upon the topic of woman. The locust-like cadences
of the songs and the shuffle of dancing feet
came muffled to us. The scent of boiling beef and the
good smoke-tang of wood fires permeated the sultry
night air, lifting my not overcivilised fancy back
into the spacious star-hung feast rooms of the dead
years, where big-boned, brawny, fighting men indulged
their lusts for steaming haunches. The full
moon lifted a Rabelaisian face of lusty red above
the hills, and I saw by its light the eager spirit of the
story-teller bright in the eyes of Yellow Fox.</p>

<p>“What they understand I do not know,” he
began; “I only know I do not understand. And I
have travelled far. When I was a young man, many
strange valleys knew my feet, and from many hilltops
my eyes looked forth. For from my first moccasins
my feet caught the itch for going. And in
many villages of strange peoples I have lived for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
little spaces, until the feasts were tasteless and the
maidens ugly. Then did my moccasins itch my feet
again, so that I went forth and sought new feasts,
other maidens.</p>

<p>“And I have known many maidens. None of
them did I understand; and least of all&mdash;Mignon.</p>

<p>“Even to-night something of the soft summer
smell of her is in my nose; and if I were not old I
would walk far, walk far; for that smell is like a
voice calling over big waters and many valleys&mdash;a
voice so far away that the ear does not catch it&mdash;so
thin that it is no sound, but a feeling.</p>

<p>“Have I told you how that a white man came to
our lands once and led me on a long, strange trail?
It happened so. He was a keeper of many strange
men and many horses and many strange animals,
and for money he showed these to many peoples,
and so grew rich.</p>

<p>“And the man showed me much money; he told
me of new lands and new peoples; he spoke of feasts,
of women that were as dreams. Therefore, I felt
the itch in my feet again, and I went with the man.
And we came at last to many big tepees, where the
man kept the strange things that he showed to the
people for money. One of his tepees was as big
as the village of a tribe&mdash;and he had many.</p>

<p>“I had my place among all these strange things;
for the white man said: ‘You are the wild man that
growls like a bear and eats babies. I give you money
and you must look very wild and growl much when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the boys stick at you with straws.’ And this was
good fun.</p>

<p>“So I stood twice every day fastened to a post
by a thong of metal. The people stood about me
and stared. I growled, I pulled at the fastenings,
I ate raw meat; I was very wild. Many came to
see, and when I would have gone back to the lands
of my people, the white man showed me more money,
so that I stayed.</p>

<p>“We travelled very far with the big tepees. We
came to the Big Salty Water, but we did not stop
there; we crossed it&mdash;and were in another land.</p>

<p>“And then there was a big village&mdash;a very big
village. There we stopped, and the people came
to see.</p>

<p>“You know that vill’ge&mdash;Par’s&mdash;Par’s?” asked
Yellow Fox, falling momentarily into English.</p>

<p>“Yes, Paris,” I corrected, “and you were with
Barnum.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” he assented, speaking his own tongue
again; “and it is a village of women that make the
eyes glad and the blood quick! I stood many days,
growling for the people and eating raw meat. And
one day Mignon came. A young man of her own
people was with her. They stared and talked much
together. Some of their talk I knew, for it was the
talk that the fur traders used, and my father’s father
was a trader for furs.</p>

<p>“And Mignon made the eyes glad. She was tall
for a woman and not thick. The women of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
people are short and thick. Her face was very white,
and her eyes were big and deep&mdash;like waters in a
shadow.</p>

<p>“And the man made jokes at me that stung like
elkhorn whips, for he was thin and looked as one
whose blood is half water. I could have choked him
with two fingers like a worm. <i>So!</i>”</p>

<p>Yellow Fox snapped his fingers viciously.</p>

<p>“And it pleased the young man to shove his
finger into my ribs and laugh. So I grasped his arm
very hard. I put his finger to my mouth; I bit it and
the blood came. He cried <i>ow ow</i>; then I said to the
woman, using what speech of hers I knew: ‘Take
this baby man of yours away or I will eat him, for
I am hungry. But you are good to see; I like you;
touch me.’</p>

<p>“And she, wondering that I spoke her speech,
touched me!</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;everything was changed!”</p>

<p>Yellow Fox suddenly passed into a subconscious
mood. The moon, grown pale with its ascent,
illumined his masterful male features, over which
I could see the dream of old days flitting like a ghost.
The song of the women dancing about the feast
fires within arose into a high and tenuous minor of
yearning, filling up the momentary gap in the story
like a chorus. In the wake of the passing gust of
song, the voice of Yellow Fox arose, soft, low,
musical&mdash;the voice of memory.</p>

<p>“Her hands she laid upon me&mdash;soft and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and thin, they were. She passed them over the
muscles of my breast; she stroked my arms. Soft
as a mother’s touch was hers; like a mother’s touch&mdash;but
I felt a fire burning at her finger tips, that
made me wish to fight big men for her, and make
them bleed and make them groan and make them
die, slobbering blood in the dust! Then afterward
to take her far away, thrown across my back like
a dead fawn; to build a lodge for her in a lonesome
place where man’s face never was!</p>

<p>“Much hair she had&mdash;much hair that hung above
her face like a dark cloud upon a white sky at evening.
And it brushed across my breast! I shivered
as in a wind that drives the snow before it&mdash;and yet
I was not cold.</p>

<p>“And then she was gone&mdash;swallowed up in the
river of people. But not all of her was gone. A
smell sweeter than the earth-smell when the spring
rains fall was in my nostrils! A smell that gnawed
within me like a hunger&mdash;yet I did not wish to eat!
A smell of soft, white flesh&mdash;oh, very soft and white!
And now in my old age I call that smell Mignon.</p>

<p>“And the people, like a noisy, muddy stream,
flowed round me, past me. But I growled no more;
for I did not wish for fun. I hated them&mdash;they
stank! An ache like the ache for home was upon
me; an ache like the ache of a man who smells the
home-smoke in a dream and wakes far off from home.</p>

<p>“Two sunlights passed&mdash;and in the evening I
stood under many lights, bound with the iron thongs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and the noisy, stinking stream of people was about
me. Their staring eyes were as many bugs that
swarmed about and stung me. I strained at the iron
thongs; I hurled the black curses of my people in
among them&mdash;and they were pleased. But this was
no play; I wished to rush among them and walk
upon them; for I had seen, and now no longer did
I see.</p>

<p>“But suddenly the smell came back! It grew up
like the smell of spring when the ice makes thunder
in the rivers and the flowers come out! And she was
there beside me.</p>

<p>“I forgot the people; I was no longer angry. I
was in a big lonesome prairie with the sunlight and
the singing winds, and she was with me, and all the
air seemed soft and cool as when a black-winged
raincloud shuts out a day of heat.</p>

<p>“I can feel her hands upon me yet.”</p>

<p class="p2">Yellow Fox sighed. A passionate outburst of
song from the dancers within filled the quiet night
with sounds of longing, through which the cowhide
drums throbbed feverishly, like a heart.</p>

<p>“And the words she spoke were soft. They made
me wish to shout the mating songs of my people.
They made me very strong. And then I learned her
name&mdash;Mignon.</p>

<p>“Mignon! Mignon! Such a sound the spring
winds make among the first leaves; and yet&mdash;it is
not all a sound; it is part a smell!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“And after that she came often; every evening
she came, like a south wind blowing over prairies
sweet with rain at sunset. Many things she asked
me and I told her many things. I made with my
mouth a picture of my own lands; and some of it
she put in a little book, and some she only drank
with all her face, as though she was thirsty.</p>

<p>“And they who had travelled far with us, the
pitchers of the tepees and the tenders of the animals,
laughed softly in passing, showing their teeth in
mirth&mdash;for were they not jealous?</p>

<p>“One night she did not come. And it happened
on that night that the big tepees were folded up for
another trail; and in the morning we were far away.
My breast cried out for her; my nose longed for the
smell which was Mignon.</p>

<p>“So I spoke of her to the pitchers of the tepees,
and they laughed very loud and long, sending forth
breaths that stank as they laughed. They said bad
things of Mignon. They said, ‘Can you not understand?
She is of those that her people have cast
out.’ And this made my breast cry out for her again;
for was I not also alone? Were not my own people
far away? But the rest of it I knew to be another
white man’s lie! One liar I struck very hard in the
teeth; and when he got up from the dust, slobbering
blood and toddling like a baby, he laughed no more
and said no more bad things of Mignon. And was
this not proof that he had lied?</p>

<p>“Is the first earth-smell of the spring bad? Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
not many maidens of the prairies longed for me;
and were they not good? Was I not big and of
heavy muscles? Was I not young and good for the
eyes of women?</p>

<p>“Since I am old and much withered, I can say
this; for I have become another man.”</p>

<p class="p2">The song of the women-singers within had ceased,
but the sullen drums kept up a throbbing snarl. At
length the voice of Yellow Fox continued in a low
monotone:</p>

<p>“We stopped in many big villages; and my breast
was sick. More and more I wished for the prairies.
At night I heard the dry winds singing in the grasses.
I spoke no more of Mignon, for I was afraid to hear
again the laughter of the pitchers of the tepees. One
more laugh would have made my eyes blind with
blood, and I would have killed.</p>

<p>“I lost the wish to eat; I grew shadow-thin. So
the owner of the tepees said: ‘This wild man is
dying for a sight of his prairies; I will send him
back.’</p>

<p>“I travelled far, and again I was in my own land.
I saw the hills; I smelled the smoke of the fires of
my people. But this no longer filled me. I had
seen, and now no longer could I see.</p>

<p>“And the winter came. I sat alone much, and
as I sat alone, I had big thoughts. I said: ‘This
that I have seen was a dream thing. It is gone; and
I cannot find the sleep trail that leads to it again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Therefore, I will do as others. I will take a woman
of my own people. I will eat again; for this dream
has only made me thin.’</p>

<p>“So I made a young woman of my people glad.
I took her into my lodge. But even through the time
of driving snows, I smelled the smell of spring.
Mignon! Mignon! I heard the rain winds singing
in the first leaves! Mignon! Mignon! I heard
the sighing of summer waters! Mignon! Mignon!
It was half a sound and half a smell&mdash;dream sound,
dream smell&mdash;so thin, so thin!</p>

<p>“And the time came when the big swift arrows
of the geese flew northward, spreading softness as
of many camp fires in all the air; and the River
wakened and shook itself, shouting with a hoarse
voice into the south. The green things came, and
there was a singing of frogs where the early rains
made pools. The smell, which was Mignon,
breathed up out of the earth; the sound, which was
Mignon, lived in the trees and grasses.</p>

<p>“And then the time came when it is no longer the
spring, and not yet quite the summer. One evening
I sat before my lodge, smoking and thinking big
thoughts. And the sun was low. A dust cloud grew
far down the road that twisted like a yellow snake
toward the village of the white men. It was a waggon
coming. It grew bigger; a white man was driving
it. It came near; there was a woman in it. I stared
very hard; I rubbed my eyes, for what I saw was
as though it had all grown up out of my pipe smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“The woman was tall and not thick. Much hair
she had&mdash;much hair that hung above her face like
a black cloud upon a white sky in the evening. And
in all the air about, there grew a smell sweeter than
the earth-smell when the spring rains fall. I sat
very still; I did not wish to frighten the dream away.
And the woman came toward me with much rustling
of garments, like the speaking of green leaves in the
wind or the thin, small drumming of raindrops.</p>

<p>“Then, between the puffing of two smoke rings,
the Spring had grown big&mdash;and was the Summer! It
was Mignon! It was Mignon!”</p>

<p class="p2">Yellow Fox lifted his face to the full moon, and
his voice was raised to a poignant cry as he uttered
the word that was half sound, half smell. Then for
some time he brooded with his chin resting in his
hands, while the women-singers within filled the
heavy air with wailings. At length he sat up and
leisurely filled his pipe. His face had become a
wrinkled mask again. He smoked awhile, then passing
the pipe to me, he continued, and his voice was
thick as though he still breathed smoke:</p>

<p>“After the snows have run away, the earth-smell
rises and all things grow drunk with it. The he-wolf
sniffs it; he forgets his last year’s mate; he takes
another and forgets. The air and the earth and the
water are full of new loves, and nothing is ashamed.</p>

<p>“It was so.</p>

<p>“When the next sunlight came I made ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the trail. I rolled up my tepee. All the while my
woman stared upon the woman who had come, with
eyes made sharp with hate. I called in my ponies
from the grazing places. I hitched a pony to the
drag. I put upon the drag the tepee and the food
and the little box that Mignon had brought with her&mdash;a
box of many garments&mdash;garments that made
songs when she walked, like the songs of rain in the
leaves. I lifted Mignon upon the drag-pony’s back,
and we rode away on the summer trail.</p>

<p>“I heard my woman wailing and crying out bitterly
in my lodge, but a spirit led me on&mdash;the spirit
that calls the green things out in the spring&mdash;the
spirit that whispers into the ear of the sleeping River
and makes it leap up and shout and tear the thongs
that bind it&mdash;the spirit that makes the wolves cry
out in the lonesome places that the mate may
hear. That spirit went calling down the trail I followed.</p>

<p>“And we came to a place by the river where the
hills were high and many leaves made coolness.
There I pitched the tepee; and the days were as little
flashes of light, and the nights were as little shadows
passing.</p>

<p>“Never before had I found it so good to live.
Mignon made songs that laughed and cried; and
when she did not sing, the rustle of her garments was
a song. I became as a squaw; I brought the wood
and water; I made the fires; I cooked. I was bowed
before her. Never before had I bowed before anyone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
for I was strong. I could not understand. She
was so soft and white and of so sweet a smell!</p>

<p>“But the time came when she no longer sang.
She grew silent, and each day gazed long upon the
river. Her hands touched me no more with the
touch of soft fires. So I grew kinder still. I spoke
soft words. I made sweet sounds to call her. But
she frowned and pushed me away.</p>

<p>“My breast ached much, so I said: ‘You think
always of that baby man whose finger I bit. I could
choke him with my fingers&mdash;<i>so</i>!’ But she laughed
in my face, making sharp jokes to fling at me. I was
stung as with whips when the whippers are angry.
I said: ‘Go back to your baby man!’</p>

<p>“I did not wish her to go; they were the words of
my anger. But she got up very straight and tall.
There was lightning in her eyes. Thunder slept in
her face. And her hair seemed as a black cloud that
blows up angrily out of the hot south!</p>

<p>“She went to the tepee; she made ready to go;
and all the while I watched with fires in my breast.
Then suddenly she turned upon me&mdash;her face was a
flame. She flung words at me: ‘You are all the
same!’ She spit in my face! I have been struck in
the teeth by strong men, but never have I felt so
hard a blow. I sat as a man in a dream. I heard
the angry song of her skirts as she fled up the back-trail.
And then I was as one who wakens with a
great hunger, and smells raw meat! I leaped up; I
ran after her; I meant to kill her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“I caught her; I struck her with my fist, even as
I struck the man who lied. I put my fingers at her
throat and pressed very hard. I carried her back to
the tepee. I thought I had killed her.</p>

<p>“Oh, the smell of her flesh as she lay very still&mdash;as
though I had stepped upon a flower!</p>

<p>“And then after a long time, when my breast was
growing sick, she opened her eyes and looked upon
me. O tender, tender were her eyes and full of soft
fires! It was the old look, only it was stronger. She
raised herself to her knees; she put her arms around
my neck; she put her lips on my lips; she called me
soft names!</p>

<p>“I thought this was some woman’s trick. I pushed
her from me. I said: ‘I am hungry; you are my
squaw; cook my food!’ And she brought wood and
water; she made a fire; she worked for me. All the
while her eyes were soft, and often she touched me
with finger tips that burned as of old with soft fires.
I could not understand. When I was kind, then was
she not kind. And now, with the blue marks of my
angry fingers at her throat, she worked for me, her
eyes were soft for me, her finger-tips were warm for
me. I cannot understand.”</p>

<p>Yellow Fox took the pipe from my hands and
smoked long in silence. He sighed deeply, breathing
in great breaths of smoke. At length, growing impatient,
I ventured a question: “And what became of
Mignon?”</p>

<p>He laid down his pipe and said in a low voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
“The woman who wailed in the lodge had not forgotten!</p>

<p>“The plums ripened,” he continued, “and the
flowers that bloomed upon our summer trail were
heavy with seed. The hills grew brown. A greyness
like smoke was in all the air. The grapes hung
thick and purple.</p>

<p>“And it happened one night when the first small
pinch of frost was in the air, that Mignon would
sing soft baby songs, such as the mothers of her
people sang, she said. Oh, such soft, low songs! I
hear them yet. A kindness was in her face, like that
in the face of a young mother. I saw it by the light
of the wood fire that held the frost away. And when
she had sung much, as to a child, she put her hands
upon my shoulders and she said a strange thing. This
is what she said, I remember: ‘Sometime, Yellow
Fox, I will sing to your <i>zhinga zhinga</i> [baby]; will
you be glad?’</p>

<p>“And I wondered much, for her eyes were wet
when she said it.</p>

<p>“And that night she fell to sleep with her soft
hands clutching my arm. And something made me
wish to sing. I watched her sleeping, and there was
an ache in my breast when I remembered the feel of
my angry fingers at her throat. And then I slept.</p>

<p>“But in that time when the night is deepest and
sleep is like a weight upon the eyes, a sharp cry woke
me. I leaped up. The fire was almost dead. I
heard feet flying through the dead leaves into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
darkness. One hand felt warm and wet; I raised it
to my nose and it was blood. And then I heard a
gasping for breath and a sound of gurgling. I put
my hand upon the breast of Mignon&mdash;and it was wet
with blood!</p>

<p>“I scraped the embers together and made a little
flame. I looked upon her face and it had the look
of death. Eyes that ached she turned upon me. I
stopped the blood with torn garments. I called her
soft names and she clutched my fingers. Then she
was very quiet. I could hear leaves dropping out in
the night.</p>

<p>“And when the face of the night turned grey, she
opened her eyes that were hot and dry. With very
weak hands she drew my ear close to her lips. She
breathed a little broken piece of song&mdash;a baby song&mdash;a
song of the mothers of her people. And when
I looked upon her again, her face was pinched, her
eyes stared.”</p>

<p class="p2">Yellow Fox lapsed into another prolonged silence.
The dancers and singers in the lodge had ceased.
A heavy, sultry silence filled the night. When he
spoke again his voice came low and muffled:</p>

<p>“I buried her after the manner of my people. I
sang the songs of the dead. Above her grave I
killed the pony that she rode. And then I went
away upon the trail that was no more the trail of
summer. But the winds in the grasses sang her
name. Mignon! Mignon! I heard the rain winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
singing in the first leaves. Mignon! Mignon! I
heard the sighing of summer waters. Mignon!
Mignon! I smelled the smell of spring. Everywhere
it was&mdash;Mignon!&mdash;half sound, half smell&mdash;dream-sound,
dream-smell&mdash;so thin&mdash;so thin.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">A POLITICAL COUP AT LITTLE OMAHA</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE struggle for Congressional honours in
the Third District of Nebraska was to be
a hard one. The white voters of the District
were about evenly divided between the two
parties, and therefore the necessary elective majority
was to be found among the Omaha Indians,
whose reservation lies in this district.</p>

<p>So this remnant of the Dark Ages became of
pivotal importance in Twentieth Century politics;
and it was here, in the wildest land of the district,
that the decisive battle of strategy must be fought.</p>

<p>For practical purposes, the intelligent white voter
ceased to exist, and there was only a slothful, ignorant
band of semi-savages who should choose by
chance the national representative of educated thousands.</p>

<p>The typical reservation Indian is primarily a
stomach, and secondarily nothing in particular. Let
him fill his belly and he is easily handled. This
axiom had been taken as a basis for action by the
whiphands of the Democratic Party, who, accordingly,
scattered broadcast throughout the reservation
considerable quantities of the meat of superannuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
bulls; sat in the feasts with cross-legged condescension;
smoked the reeking stone pipes; drank hot soup
with the suppressed shudders of a revolting stomach,
and called the brown men “brothers.”</p>

<p>This had all worked very well in the latter days
of September, and there had been considerable rejoicing
in local Democratic circles over the bright
prospects for a sweeping majority.</p>

<p>It was not until the first of October that the opposition
suddenly hurled a thunderbolt out of the blue
sky of its seemingly serene inactivity. The Agent,
holding his appointment under a Republican administration,
announced at a weekly land payment that
$100,000 of the considerable sum held in trust by
the Government would be paid pro rata to the
Omahas during the month. It was after this announcement
that the local leaders of the Republican
Party became active. They explained to their
brothers how surpassingly good it was of them to
bring about this payment. Would their brothers
forget this at the November election? Of course
not!</p>

<p>So it happened that the bull meat lost its power of
persuasion and for several weeks there was not a
brown Democrat on the reserve. Thus, at the opening
of the big payment on a Monday morning two
weeks before election, the Democratic candidate for
Congress found himself staring Defeat in the face
(which was brown) after having enjoyed several
weeks of victory (which was premature).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The “big payment” has always been picturesque
and is now fast becoming impossible. It may be
defined as the spectacular bow of the Present to the
Past, with which Civilisation lowers its proud plume
and says to the Savage Age: “Sorry I swiped your
land; take that and don’t feel sore!” Or words to
that effect.</p>

<p>The opening days of the big payment were warm
with the lazy warmth of the mellow, golden hours
of late October. The untilled hills of the reservation
thrust themselves up into the autumn glare,
unashamed of their poverty of soil. The Agency
building nestled forlornly in a creek valley surrounded
by the yellow, wrinkled hills.</p>

<p>In the early morning a lazy string of vehicles began
to pour into the Agency from the dozen or more
roads that outraged the compass with their crazy
windings, and seamed the bronze face of the prairie
with ugly scars. Carts, buggies, waggons, carriages,
some of glaring newness, weighted down to the
axles with squaws, papooses and the inevitable mortgage;
others in an epileptic stage of decay, with the
weary air of having borne the weight of outlawed
paper for many moons; ponies, long-haired, and
emaciated with many unconsoling feeds of post and
halter, carrying at once upon their sawlike backs
their sweating, heavy masters, and (heavier than
these) the seeming consciousness of long-dishonoured
promissory notes; these constituted the grotesque
Republican procession that streamed into Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Omaha, as the Agency is called, on that morning in
October.</p>

<p>It was as a tribal exodus. The entire tribe of
twelve hundred odd men, women, and children was
leaving its shacks and tepees that morning, in search
of the minted eagles of the Government, just as, of
old, they moved in a hungry body upon the trail of
the bison.</p>

<p>As the vanguard of this grand but dilapidated
army of the primitive world closed in upon the
Agency, it was met by the vanguard of the greater
commercial army of civilisation, and a wordy skirmish
ensued. These were the inevitable collectors
who hang about an Indian payment like a crowd of
crows scenting a carcass. One might have heard
such a conversation as this above the tumult of the
meeting races:</p>

<p>“Well, Big Bear, goin’ to pay that note to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ugh?”</p>

<p>“I say [voice raised a key], are you goin’ to
pay that note&mdash;<i>muska zhinga, wabugazee</i> [money,
note]?”</p>

<p>“<i>Unkazhee!</i>” (Don’t understand.)</p>

<p>“Damn your black hide, Big Bear, you can talk
as good as I can! I say, [voice raised to a shriek]
if you don’t pay that note, I’ll come over to your
place and take every dodgasted, straw-bellied <i>shonga</i>
[pony] you’ve got!”</p>

<p>“Gad up!”</p>

<p>And the delinquent debtor put the whip to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
long-haired, shambling mortgages and disappeared
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>The Omaha is a genius for contracting debts. At
the beginning of the big payment, the aggregate
debts of the tribe were roughly estimated at
$200,000, the living representative of long-digested
groceries, starved ponies, shattered vehicles and forgotten
alcoholic debauches.</p>

<p>The Government, in the wisdom of blindness, had
caused large placards to be posted at the entrances to
the Agency grounds, bearing this order: “No collector
of any description shall be allowed within a
radius of half a mile from the pay station.” Accordingly,
the burly Indian police strutted about in blue
clothes and brass buttons obstreperously hustling the
white creditors over the half-mile line, where they
lounged in disconsolate groups along the dusty highway,
playing mumble-peg, pitching horseshoes, and
verbally sending the entire tribe to the devil.</p>

<p>“Be cussed if I don’t hate to see the Twentieth
Century kicked downstairs this way by the Dark
Ages! Cussed if I don’t!” Thus a little wiry, pale-faced
undertaker was heard to exclaim. His name
was Comfort and he appeared to be a positive misery
both to himself and to the delinquent relatives of
the many good Indians he had laid away.</p>

<p>Beside the little undertaker, there were lawyers,
bankers’ clerks, grocerymen, liverymen, middlemen,
butchers, doctors, and a half dozen politicians, there
for the purpose of whipping the brown voters into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
line. There were men like wolves, bears, dogs,
goats, roosters, beetles, scorpions. The little undertaker
was the scorpion; a middleman was like a bear;
there was a banker’s clerk like a goat; and a thin,
angular, tall politician, with a body appropriately
like an interrogation point, who slunk about like a
hungry wolf.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock the last stragglers of the tribe had
arrived and the Agency grounds were filled with
circles of sweating, brown men, women, and children,
passing the stone pipe, tranquilly awaiting the coming
of the Agent, whose name, upon a reservation, is a
shout.</p>

<p>By 10:30 the Agent appeared, riding down the
dusty road from his residence. He was preceded by
mounted police of pompous bearing, who shouted
“The Agent! Make way for the Agent!” to the
circles of their tribesmen who sat in the dust of the
highway.</p>

<p>A short while afterward the loungers at the half-mile
line heard the voice of a crier at the door
of the pay station, calling the first name on the roll
in the golden autumnal silence.</p>

<p>“<i>Nuzhee Mona! Geegoho!</i>” (Rain Walker!
Come here!)</p>

<p>Then the fact that Mr. Rainwalker, a leader of
the tribe much indebted to the white man, was about
to be paid, became volatile as ammonia, and the fluttering
of time-yellowed legal paper was heard along
the waiting line of creditors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Owes me $6.46 with interest for four years!”</p>

<p>“Me $25 and interest&mdash;outlawed!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the old cuss’s note for fifty!”</p>

<p>“I buried his fourth and sixth wives,” squeaked
the little undertaker, “seven and nine years ago,
respectively!”</p>

<p>Such exclamations ran down the line like a volley
in different variations of vocal emphasis.</p>

<p>“Wonder how he’s votin’,” mused the hungry
wolf of a politician.</p>

<p>“To the devil with politics!” roared the bear of
a middleman; “I want the rent back I advanced
him!”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Rainwalker was seen to leave
the station, mount his pony, and proceed down the
dusty road toward the half-mile line. It had doubtless
occurred to him that during past winters it had
been necessary to eat, and he was coming forth to
make peace with the groceryman.</p>

<p>At sight of the approaching debtor, the lounging
line of creditors sprang to its feet and stood at attention.
The grocer, who spoke the Omaha tongue
fluently and had a snug fortune laid away in consequence,
walked rapidly in advance of the others and
met Mr. Rainwalker at the line, followed by the
straggling crowd of expectant creditors like a trailing
cloud of hungry crows.</p>

<p>Mr. Rainwalker had a large, round, pockmarked
face that looked for the world like a pumpkin pie
overbaked by a careless cook, with a monstrous nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
in the centre of it. He sat placidly upon his pony,
that had all the salient points of a starved cow, and
dozed luxuriously at the shortest halt. The old
chief seemed the visible body of an optimistic joke,
sitting upon the bone heap of a tragedy!</p>

<p>The grocer had barely collected the greater share
of the old man’s check, when he became the centre of
a noisy, gesticulating crowd of creditors. It was the
chatter of the crows about the carrion.</p>

<p>“You know you promised me that you would
settle that note!” said the goatlike bank clerk in his
bleating voice.</p>

<p>“How about that rent money I advanced, Rainwalker?”
roared the bear-like middleman.</p>

<p>“I want my money for them wives I buried for
you&mdash;<i>two of ’em</i>!” squeaked the scorpionlike undertaker,
holding up two explanatory fingers and thrusting
his thin, pale face into the mêlée.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” the old man answered rather unsatisfactorily.</p>

<p>“If you don’t pay me,” shrieked the incensed
little undertaker, “I’ll go right out on the hill and
<i>dig up them boxes, by God</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i>Muska ningay!</i>” (no money) said the old man.
“No pay ’em chil’n’s money tall. All time lie to
us. Goan votem Dimmiticrat, guess.”</p>

<p>And with this statement, bearing with it the fate
of a national representative, the old chief kicked the
tenacious slumber out of his pony and rode back to
the Agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eh?” ejaculated the politician; “Votin’ Democratic,
eh? Well, I’ll be cussed! It’ll snow us under!
Why in thunder do they refuse to pay the money to
the minor children? I tell you, gentlemen, it’ll snow
us under!”</p>

<p>“Drat politics!” squeaked the little undertaker.
“Wisht I’d a-buried ’em all afore now. Cussed if
I don’t go right out on that there hill and dig them
boxes up!”</p>

<p>The day wore on with an alarming recrudescence
of Democracy among the red men (who are not red,
but chocolate). In the afternoon, the little undertaker
chased White Horse, another leading man of
the tribe, into the brush and returned with a broad
grin upon his face.</p>

<p>“Beats the devil!” ejaculated the thin politician,
“where a body sometimes finds merriment! How’s
he votin’, Comfort?”</p>

<p>“Votin’ Democrat&mdash;the whole cussed posse of
’em! But I don’t give a cuss&mdash;Democrat or Republican
money’s all the same to me. I got $15;
one of his kids I planted five years ago; died of
Cuban itch; four-foot pine box! He, he, he! I don’t
give a cuss how they’re votin’.”</p>

<p>That night there was a meeting of Republican
politicians at the Agency office. A most alarming
landslide had begun that day, bearing disaster to the
ranks of the Grand Old Party.</p>

<p>“Some more of those confounded departmental
rulings!” exclaimed the Agent to the company present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
“It’s this grandmotherly solicitude for the
Indian that makes him an irresponsible scamp. Why,
if the Government had turned them all loose to sink
or swim a decade ago, Natural Law would, by this
time, have solved the much mooted Indian question.
But what are we to do?” And the Agent stroked
his Van Dyke beard in perplexity.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something,” said the lean wolf
with the body like a question mark; “and there’s
only one thing to do&mdash;get Meekleman here. You
remember how he wheedled them into line four years
ago. If there’s a man in the world who can bring
them around, it’s Meekleman. And we’d better get
McBarty here, too. The two of them may be able
to kick up a successful powwow.”</p>

<p>Charles D. Meekleman was a Nebraska politician
who was almost a statesman, and had held important
positions in Washington official circles. McBarty
was the Republican candidate for Congress. It was
decided that they should be sent for at once.</p>

<p>It was Friday evening when the two great men
arrived; and upon Saturday morning they came forth
and allowed themselves to be gazed upon freely.
McBarty was a heavy-set, middle-sized man, with an
earnest expression of countenance, and the rather
bewildered air of a candidate being led forth to
sacrifice for the first time. Meekleman was tall,
superbly built, clad in the faultless manner and bearing
about him that air of refinement which had won
him from his rural constituents the name of “Gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Charlie.” The manner of his shaking hands
with any comer was most consummate flattery; and
although it was done with an air of magnanimous
condescension, there was something masterful in his
eyes, looking down kindly from his heavy brows, as
from a battlemented tower, that established the
utmost confidence. He had the happy faculty of
disposing of a boiled potato at a farmhouse with a
refined dignity acquired over many a French dish
at the banquets of the distinguished; and the manner
in which he addressed a bunch of squaws and bucks
as “ladies and gentlemen,” was surpassingly suave.</p>

<p>The two great men strolled leisurely, arm in arm,
down the dusty road to the pay station, stopping
often to shake hands with the Omahas, and radiating
smiles like small human suns. When they had
reached the pay station, Mr. Meekleman approached
the Agent, busy signing checks, and said in his big,
clear, slow voice, that it might be heard by the lounging
Indians: “Major, I wish you would announce
to the gentlemen that I want to talk to them this
evening over at Fire Chief lodge. Tell the gentlemen
that I am very much grieved for them, and that
I shall endeavour to right their wrongs;” and he
raised his heavy brows and condescendingly smiled
upon the brown loungers, while the Agent instructed
a policeman to make the announcement.</p>

<p>That evening a party consisting of the Agent,
Messrs. Meekleman and McBarty, and several local
politicians, proceeded on foot to Fire Chief lodge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which is a large octagonal shack placed in a lonesome
valley a mile distant from the Agency.</p>

<p>“Brace up, Mac!” said Meekleman, as the two
walked along the lonesome prairie road. “To-night
I shall have the honour to make a man of you&mdash;the
Honourable James McBarty! Have a cigar and try
to keep cool.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. I was just feeling a little surprised
at the lonesome road that seems to lead to Congress&mdash;that
was all. Do you really suppose we can win
them over?”</p>

<p>“Well, you shall see,” returned Meekleman.
“Follow my suit and don’t make faces at the soup;
for one really must drink soup, you know, to be
Congressman from this district. I say, Mac, did you
ever smoke killikinick? Well, anyway, I advise you
to smoke it to-night till the back of your neck aches.
Ha, ha! There is really no royal road to Congress,
Mac!” And Meekleman slapped the candidate
upon the shoulder and filled the great prairie silence
with jovial laughter.</p>

<p>As the party neared the lodge, from which the
light of the fire within streamed out through the
windows into the moon haze, they heard the sound
of the drum and the singing that accompanies an
Indian feast; a wild melodious flight of notes,
threaded with the snarl of the drum like the beat of
a fevered temple, rising in ecstasy, like the wail of
a fitful night wind in the scrub oaks of a bluff, and
falling suddenly to die in a guttural note like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
burr of a wounded rattlesnake. A barbaric music
filled with the sounds of Nature and old as the
wrinkled prairie!</p>

<p>“This,” said Meekleman, stopping near the entrance
to listen to the deep, beautiful voices within,
“This, McBarty, is the Indian of romance. Now for
the bitter truth&mdash;and the soup!”</p>

<p>As they entered the long, narrow passageway leading
into the lodge, they saw before them a large
octagonal room with a wood fire blazing in the
centre. About the dusky walls the huge, perverted
shadows of the singers flitted in grotesque dances as
they swayed in the ecstasy of song. A circle of
brown men sat about the sputtering fire over which a
large iron kettle steamed forth the scent of beef.
Near the circle sat the smaller circle of drummers
about a washtub with a cowhide stretched
across it.</p>

<p>Within the larger circle near the fire, sat a squaw,
cutting bits of beef from a quantity of ribs that she
held conveniently in her lap.</p>

<p>“Shade of Mrs. Rorer!” exclaimed the would-be
Congressman in a whisper to his companion; “is <i>that</i>
the soup?”</p>

<p>“Hist!” returned Meekleman; “one should be
willing to suffer for his country!”</p>

<p>At the entrance of the great men, the singing
ceased abruptly, and the singers turned their sullen,
brute-like eyes upon their visitors and grunted.</p>

<p>“Are there any of the leading men here?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Meekleman of the Agent. Rainwalker and White
Horse were both present.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Meekleman, pointing to an unusually
homely old Indian; “who is that black scamp with
the big face and the re<i>mark</i>ably stupendous
nose?”</p>

<p>“Rainwalker,” replied the Agent; “a leader; it
would be well to make peace with him first.”</p>

<p>Meekleman approached the old chief with his soft,
white hand extended and his face the picture of
rapture.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Rainwalker! Here you are! I’m
glad to see you, Mr. Rainwalker! How well you
look; I needn’t ask about your health; your complexion
could scarcely be surpassed!”</p>

<p>Mr. Rainwalker turned a shade lighter with pride
and grinned, returning the great man’s salutation
with a large bunch of beef-scented silence.</p>

<p>Meekleman sat down cross-legged in the circle
and took the circulating stone pipe in his turn, smoked
heroically and drank large quantities of hot soup.
The sullen faces of the firelit circle brightened. Old
Rainwalker began to talk in his own tongue, staring
meanwhile meditatively into the fire. For several
minutes his deep musical voice ran on with occasional
dignified pauses and gestures indicating that he spoke
of the great white man beside him. Meekleman
gave an Indian youth a coin to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>“He says,” said the youth, “that you all time
walk with good people and eat good stuff, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
are not too good, he says, to smoke and eat with us,
he says. He likes you pretty much, guess.”</p>

<p>The old chief talked again for some time, and
then lapsed into dignified silence.</p>

<p>“He says,” continued the youth, “that you have
lived in the same lodge with the Big Father at Washington,
and you can get the money for the chil’ns, he
guess. That’s what he says.”</p>

<p>“Tell my dear brother,” said Meekleman, “that
my heart is warm toward my brown brothers, and
that the children shall have their money. Tell him
that I played with the Big Father when he was a
little boy, and that I know the Big Father would be
terribly angry if he knew that the children had been
refused their money. Tell him that I will see that
they get it.”</p>

<p>This short speech translated, sent a murmur of joy
around the circle. White Horse arose from the
opposite side of the circle and brought a cup of hot
soup to his white brother as a special favour.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Meekleman, arising majestically
as befitted the erstwhile playmate of the President,
“I shall introduce to you Mr. McBarty. He will
go to Washington for you and he will do many good
things for the Omahas.”</p>

<p>Mr. McBarty came forth and fell to shaking the
brown hands of the grown-up children. He started
with Rainwalker, who carefully rubbed his left hand
upon his blanket before presenting it to the future
saviour of his race. Then after having shaken all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the hands, including that of the squaw who stripped
beef from the ribs, the potential Congressman fell
heroically upon the soup and the killikinick.</p>

<p>An old Indian placed cross-legged near a wood fire
with the feel of hot soup in his belly, invariably becomes
reminiscent. Old White Horse sat staring
into the sputtering flame with his face as expressionless
as a stone statue of Buddha, and his voice began
in a low, musical tone, rising as his memory quickened,
and modulated with great oratorical skill,
for which he was noted in the tribe. His words
translated ran thus:</p>

<p>“These new times are not like the old times.
When we old men were young and the bison still
bellowed on the prairies, we were strong and swift
and wise. Now we are weak and slow and not wise.
I cannot understand. It is all like a day when there
is fog everywhere. When we were young and
fought the Pawnees and the Sioux, there were no
bigger, wiser men than Nuzhee Mona [Rainwalker]
and Shonga Ska [White Horse]. Look at us now!
We are old and slow and we cannot see far to-day.
Once when I was young I found a sick bison bull
wandering in the hills. He was weak and half blind
and he had lost the trail. We are weak and half
blind and we cannot find the old trail. I cannot
understand.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, ah!” A groan ran about the firelit
circle, intent upon the old wise man’s word.</p>

<p>“We cannot find Wakunda [God] any more. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
is not in the valleys any more, nor on the hills. We
cannot talk to the big white Wakunda. What can
we old men say to our foolish people when they need
wise words? Every day they are more like badgers.
They eat much, drink firewater, and are very foolish.
But we have these white brothers and we will listen
to them. Their wisdom is the new wisdom; we will
listen to them.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah!” assented the listeners.</p>

<p>For an hour the circle sat staring into the flame,
thinking of the old times. Then without a word,
Rainwalker and White Horse arose and passed out
of the lodge and the others followed.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Meekleman to McBarty, as they
walked along the lonesome road toward the Agency,
“I have the honour to address the Hon. James
McBarty!”</p>

<p>The other did not answer for several minutes.</p>

<p>“Meekleman,” said McBarty at length, “don’t
you suppose I <i>can</i> do something for these poor
devils?”</p>

<p>“Ah, McBarty,” returned Meekleman, “I am
afraid you will never be a politician!”</p>

<p>Upon the following Monday morning when the
tribe gathered for the continuation of the big payment,
the news began to circulate that the great white
man had gone to see the Big Father at Washington
about the payment of the money to the minor children.
As this news was authenticated by White
Horse and Rainwalker themselves, it was readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
believed, and in one day four hundred brown votes
swung over to the Republican faith again.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a week before election, there was not
a brown Democrat on the reserve. This state of
affairs continued on through the week until Friday
evening, at which time no word had come from the
Big Father.</p>

<p>The Democratic candidate for Congress, Judge
Roberts, had arrived at the Agency during the week
to battle in person against the impending calamity.
All week he and his retainers led the forlorn hope.
But on Friday afternoon, when the news so impatiently
awaited by the Indians had not yet arrived,
the all but lost cause began to gain a foothold in a
persistent rumour that hinted that maybe the Indian
had been fooled after all. Maybe Meekleman didn’t
intend to intercede for the Indians at all; and accordingly,
one by one, the brown men wondered, doubted,
wavered and lost hope, until by Saturday evening,
when the pay station closed, there had begun a restless,
slow, and certain movement among the Omahas
toward the Democratic ranks.</p>

<p>When Monday morning came, twenty-four hours
before the opening of the polls, the political condition
of the Omahas could have been summed up in
one laconic conversation:</p>

<p>“Well, <i>cuggie</i>, [friend] how are you voting?”</p>

<p>“Dimmiticrat, guess!”</p>

<p>McBarty strolled leisurely about among the Omahas
with an enigmatical smile upon his face, seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to be unconscious of the crushing defeat he was,
apparently, about to receive. The day wore on and
hour by hour grew the triumph of the Judge, who
now already felt himself the “Gentleman from
Nebraska.”</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the evening the two candidates
were seen talking together at the door of the pay
station.</p>

<p>“Well, Mac,” said the Judge, “it’s looking a
little dark for you. I swear, a week ago I would
have sold my chances for a cent!”</p>

<p>McBarty repeatedly looked up the dusty government
trail leading north from the station with an
expression of anxiety.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “allow me to congratulate the
Hon. John Roberts of Nebraska!” He smiled
gravely as he shook the hand of his rival. “All I
regret now,” he added, “is that I drank that soup!”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” replied the Judge. “It really seems
a shame, however, that one should go to Congress
at the hands of these savages, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said McBarty, taking a long gaze up the
trail; “it is a shame, to be sure!”</p>

<p>At that moment a little farce was being enacted a
mile up the road. Within the covering of a wild
plum thicket at the side of the trail a saddled and
bridled horse was lariated to a stake, and a man sat
near by upon a rock, repeatedly tapping the horse
on the flanks as it galloped about in a circle.</p>

<p>“Lather up there!” cried the man, as he nipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the horse with the whiplash; “lather up there!”
And the horse dashed about the circle until its flanks
were dripping and its mouth was white with foam.</p>

<p>At length the man took out his watch, saw that
it was 5:30 o’clock, and untying the lariat, he
mounted and put the spurs to his already jaded
animal, dashing at a furious pace down the dusty
old trail toward the Agency.</p>

<p>A few moments later McBarty and the Judge
caught sight of a furious rider dashing toward them
in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose that can be riding so
fast?” said the Judge.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said McBarty, smiling broadly, “that,
Judge, is merely my election coming up at the
gallop!”</p>

<p>Amid dust and yelling and a general spectacular
confusion the horseman dashed up to the door of the
pay station, threw his horse on its haunches in stopping,
and cried: “A telegram from Washington for
the Agent!”</p>

<p>In a few moments a great crowd of Indians had
gathered about the horse and rider. The Agent,
with a smile upon his face, rushed out of the station
and seized a bit of yellow paper that the rider held
in his hand. Breathlessly the crowd of Omahas
waited.</p>

<p>“Listen!” shouted a crier in the Omaha tongue,
standing by the Agent, who was reading the telegram.
“The Big Father at Washington sends this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
word to his brown brothers: ‘The children’s money
shall be paid!’”</p>

<p>For a moment following the shout of the crier,
there was a great silence. Then a roar went up from
the Omahas&mdash;a wild, hoarse shout of joy! Judge
Roberts turned pale, and extending his hand to
McBarty, said: “Well, you have won. Allow me
to congratulate the Hon. James McBarty of Nebraska.”</p>

<p>And when the next morning’s sun arose, the polls
were besieged by a throng of brown Republicans.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAST THUNDER SONG</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT is an ancient custom to paint tragedy in blood
tints. This is because men were once merely
animals, and have not as yet been able to live
down their ancestry. Yet the stroke of a dagger is
a caress beside the throb of hopeless days.</p>

<p>Life can ache; the living will tell you this. But
the dead make no complaint.</p>

<p>There is no greater tragedy than the fall of a
dream! Napoleon dreamed; so did a savage. It is
the same. I know of the scene of a great tragedy.
Very few have recognised it as such; there was so
little noise along with it. It happened at the Omaha
Agency, which is situated on the Missouri River
some seventy miles above Omaha.</p>

<p>The summer of 1900 debilitated all thermal adjectives.
It was not hot; it was <i>Saharical</i>! It would
hardly have been hyperbole to have said that the
Old Century lay dying of a fever. The untilled hills
of the reservation thrust themselves up in the August
sunshine like the emaciated joints of one bedridden.
The land lay as yellow as the skin of a fever patient,
except in those rare spots where the melancholy corn
struggled heartlessly up a hillside, making a blotch
like a bedsore!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood of the prairie was impoverished, and
the sky would give no drink with which to fill the
dwindling veins. When one wished to search the
horizon for the cloud that was not there, he did it
from beneath an arched hand. The small whirlwinds
that awoke like sudden fits of madness in the
sultry air, rearing yellow columns of dust into the
sky&mdash;these alone relieved the monotony of dazzle.</p>

<p>Every evening the clouds rolled flashing about the
horizon and thundered back into the night. They
were merely taunts, like the holding of a cool cup
just out of reach of a fevered mouth; and the clear
nights passed, bringing dewless dawns, until the
ground cracked like a parched lip!</p>

<p>The annual Indian powwow was to be ended prematurely
that year, for the sun beat uninvitingly upon
the flat bottom where the dances were held, and the
Indians found much comfort in the shade of their
summer tepees. But when it was noised about that,
upon the next day, the old medicine-man Mahowari
(Passing Cloud) would dance potent dances and sing
a thunder song with which to awaken the lazy thunder
spirits to their neglected duty of rain-making,
then the argument of the heat became feeble.</p>

<p>So the next morning, the bronze head of every
Indian tepeehold took his pony, his dogs, his squaw,
and his papooses of indefinite number to the powwow
ground. In addition to these, the old men carried
with them long memories and an implicit faith.</p>

<p>The young men, who had been away to Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
school, and had succeeded to some extent in stuffing
their brown skins with white souls, carried with them
curiosity and doubt, which, if properly united, beget
derision.</p>

<p>The old men went to a shrine; the young men
went to a show. When a shrine becomes a show, the
World advances a step. And <i>that</i> is the benevolence
of Natural Law!</p>

<p>About the open space in which the dances were
held, an oval covering had been built with willow
boughs, beneath which the Indians lounged in sweating
groups. Slowly about the various small circles
went the cumbersome stone pipes.</p>

<p>To one listening, drowsed with the intense sunshine,
the <i>buzzle</i> and mutter and snarl of the gossiping
Omahas seemed the grotesque echoes from a
vanished age. Between the fierce dazzle of the sun
and the sharply contrasting blue shade, there was
but a line of division; yet a thousand years lay
between one gazing in the sun and those dozing in
the shadow. It was as if God had flung down a
bit of the Young World’s twilight into the midst of
the Old World’s noon. Here lounged the masterpiece
of the toiling centuries&mdash;a Yankee. There sat
the remnant of a race as primitive as Israel. Yet
the white man looked on with the contempt of
superiority.</p>

<p>Before ten o’clock everybody had arrived and his
family with him. A little group, composed of the
Indian Agent, the Agency Physician, the Mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Preacher, and a newspaper man, down from the city
for reportorial purposes, waited and chatted, sitting
upon a ragged patch of available shadow.</p>

<p>“These Omahas are an exceptional race,” the
preacher was saying in his ministerial tone of voice;
“an exceptional race!”</p>

<p>The newspaper man mopped his face, lit a cigarette
and nodded assent with a hidden meaning
twinkling in his eye.</p>

<p>“Quite exceptional!” he said, tossing his head
in the direction of an unusually corpulent bunch of
steaming, sweating, bronze men and women. “God,
like some lesser master-musicians, has not confined
himself to grand opera, it seems!”</p>

<p>He took a long pull at his cigarette, and his next
words came out in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>“This particular creation savours somewhat of
opera bouffe!”</p>

<p>With severe unconcern the preacher mended the
broken thread of his discourse. “Quite an exceptional
race in many ways. The Omaha is quite as
honest as the white man.”</p>

<p>“That is a truism!” The pencil-pusher drove
this observation between the minister’s words like a
wedge.</p>

<p>“In his natural state he was much more so,”
uninterruptedly continued the preacher; he was used
to continuous discourse. “I have been told by many
of the old men that in the olden times an Indian
could leave his tepee for months at a time, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
his return would find his most valuable possessions
untouched. I tell you, gentlemen, the Indian is like
a prairie flower that has been transplanted from the
blue sky and the summer sun and the pure winds into
the steaming, artificial atmosphere of the hothouse!
A glass roof is not the blue sky! Man’s talent is
not God’s genius! That is why you are looking at a
perverted growth.</p>

<p>“Look into an Indian’s face and observe the ruins
of what was once manly dignity, indomitable energy,
masterful prowess! When I look upon one of these
faces, I have the same thoughts as, when travelling
in Europe, I looked upon the ruins of Rome.</p>

<p>“Everywhere broken arches, fallen columns,
tumbled walls! Yet through these as through a mist
one can discern the magnificence of the living city.
So in looking upon one of these faces, which are
merely ruins in another sense. They were once as
noble, as beautiful as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>In his momentary search for an eloquent simile,
the minister paused.</p>

<p>“As pumpkin pies!” added the newspaper man
with a chuckle; and he whipped out his notebook
and pencil to jot down this brilliant thought, for he
had conceived a very witty “story” which he would
pound out for the Sunday edition.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Agency Physician, finally sucked
into the whirlpool of discussion, “it seems to me that
there is no room for crowing on either side. Indians
are pretty much like white men; livers and kidneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and lungs, and that sort of thing; slight difference in
the pigment under the skin. I’ve looked into the
machinery of both species and find just as much room
in one as the other for a soul!”</p>

<p>“And both will go upward,” added the minister.</p>

<p>“Like different grades of tobacco,” observed the
Indian Agent, “the smoke of each goes up in the
same way.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said the reporter; “but let us cut out
the metaphysics. I wonder when this magical <i>cuggie</i>
is going to begin his humid evolutions. Lamentable,
isn’t it, that, such institutions as rain prayers should
exist on the very threshold of the Twentieth
Century?”</p>

<p>“I think,” returned the minister, “that the Twentieth
Century has no intention of eliminating God!
This medicine-man’s prayer, in my belief, is as
sacred as the prayer of any churchman. The difference
between Wakunda and God is merely orthographical.”</p>

<p>“But,” insisted the cynical young man from the
city, “I had not been taught to think of God as of
one who forgets! Do you know what I would do
if I had no confidence in the executive ability of my
God?”</p>

<p>Taking the subsequent silence as a question, the
young man answered: “Why, I would take a day
off and whittle one out of wood!”</p>

<p>“A youth’s way is the wind’s way,” quoted the
preacher, with a paternal air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the thoughts of youth are long, long
thoughts; but what is all this noise about?” returned
the reporter.</p>

<p>A buzz of expectant voices had grown at one end
of the oval, and had spread contagiously throughout
the elliptical strip of shade. For with slow, majestic
step the medicine-man, Mahowari, entered the enclosure
and walked toward the centre. The fierce
sun emphasised the brilliancy of the old man’s garments
and glittered upon the profusion of trinkets,
the magic heirlooms of the medicine-man. It was
not the robe nor the dazzling trinkets that caught
the eye of one acquainted with Mahowari. It was
the erectness of his figure, for he had been bowed
with years, and many vertical suns had shone upon
the old man’s back since his face had been turned
toward the ground. But now with firm step and
form rigidly erect he walked.</p>

<p>Any sympathetic eye could easily read the thoughts
that passed through the old man’s being like an elixir
infusing youth. Now in his feeble years would come
his greatest triumph! To-day he would sing with
greater power than ever he had sung. Wakunda
would hear the cry. The rains would come! Then
the white men would be stricken with belief!</p>

<p>Already his heart sang before his lips. In spite
of the hideous painting of his face, the light of
triumph shone there like the reflection of a great
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly he approached the circle of drummers who
sat in the glaring centre of the ellipse of sunlight.
It was all as though the First Century had awakened
like a ghost and stood in the very doorway of the
Twentieth!</p>

<p>When Mahowari had approached within a yard
of the drums, he stopped, and raising his arms and
his eyes to the cloudless sky, uttered a low cry like a
wail of supplication. Then the drums began to
throb with that barbaric music as old as the world;
a sound like the pounding of a fever temple, with a
recurring snarl like the warning of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Every sound of the rejoicing and suffering prairie
echoes in the Indian’s drum.</p>

<p>With a slow, majestic bending of the knees and
an alternate lifting of his feet, the medicine-man
danced in a circle about the snarling drums. Then
like a faint wail of winds toiling up a wooded bluff,
his thunder song began.</p>

<p>The drone and whine of the mysterious, untranslatable
words pierced the drowse of the day, lived
for a moment with the echoes of the drums among
the surrounding hills, and languished from a whisper
into silence. At intervals the old man raised his
face, radiant with fanatic ecstasy, to the meridian
glare of the sun, and the song swelled to a supplicating
shout.</p>

<p>Faster and faster the old man moved about the
circle; louder and wilder grew the song. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
watched from the shade were absorbed in an intense
silence, which, with the drowse of the sultry day,
made every sound a paradox! The old men forgot
their pipes and sat motionless.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at one end of the covering, came the
sound of laughter! At first an indefinite sound like
the spirit of merriment entering a capricious dream
of sacred things; then it grew and spread until it
was no longer merriment, but a loud jeer of derision!
It startled the old men from the intenseness of their
watching. They looked up and were stricken with
awe. The young men were jeering this, the holiest
rite of their fathers!</p>

<p>Slower and slower the medicine-man danced;
fainter and fainter grew the song and ceased
abruptly. With one quick glance, Mahowari saw
the shattering of his hopes. He glanced at the sky;
but saw no swarm of black spirits to avenge such
sacrilege. Only the blaze of the sun, the glitter of
the arid zenith!</p>

<p>In that one moment, the temporary youth of the
old man died out. His shoulders drooped to their
wonted position. His limbs tottered. He was old
again.</p>

<p>It was the Night stricken heart-sick with the
laughter of the Dawn. It was the audacious Present
jeering at the Past, tottering with years. At that
moment, the impudent, cruel, brilliant youth called
Civilisation snatched the halo from the grey hairs
of patriarchal Ignorance. Light flouted the rags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of Night. A clarion challenge shrilled across the
years.</p>

<p>Never before in all the myriad moons had such
a thing occurred. It was too great a cause to produce
an effect of grief or anger. It stupefied. The
old men and women sat motionless. They could not
understand.</p>

<p>With uneven step and with eyes that saw nothing,
Mahowari passed from among his kinsmen and tottered
up the valley toward his lonesome shack and
tepee upon the hillside. It was far past noon when
the last of the older Omahas left the scene of the
dance.</p>

<p>The greater number of the white men who had
witnessed the last thunder dance of the Omahas
went homeward much pleased. The show had
turned out quite funny indeed. “Ha, ha, ha! Did
you see how surprised the old <i>cuggy</i> looked? He,
he, he!” Life, being necessarily selfish, argues from
its own standpoint.</p>

<p>But as the minister rode slowly toward his home
there was no laughter in his heart. He was saying
to himself: “If the whole fabric of my belief should
suddenly be wrenched from me, what then?” Even
this question was born of selfishness, but it brought
pity.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening the minister mounted
his horse and rode to the home of Mahowari, which
was a shack in the winter and a tepee in the summer.
Dismounting, he threw the bridle reins upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
ground, and raised the door flap of the tepee. Mahowari
sat cross-legged upon the ground, staring
steadily before him with unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>“How!” said the minister.</p>

<p>The old Indian did not answer. There was no
expression of grief or anger or despair upon his face.
He sat like a statue. Yet, the irregularity of his
breathing showed where the pain lay. An Indian
suffers in his breast. His face is a mask.</p>

<p>The minister sat down in front of the silent old
man and, after the immemorial manner of ministers,
talked of a better world, of a pitying Christ, and of
God, the Great Father. For the first time the Indian
raised his face and spoke briefly in English:</p>

<p>“God? He dead, guess!”</p>

<p>Then he was silent again for some time.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes lit up with a light that was not
the light of age. The heart of his youth had awakened.
The old memories came back and he spoke
fluently in his own tongue, which the minister understood.</p>

<p>“These times are not like the old times. The
young men have caught some of the wisdom of the
white man. Nothing is sure. It is not good. I cannot
understand. Everything is young and new. All
old things are dead. Many moons ago, the wisdom
of Mahowari was great. I can remember how my
father said to me one day when I was yet young and
all things lay new before me: ‘Let my son go to a
high hill and dream a great dream’; and I went up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in the evening and cried out to Wakunda and I slept
and dreamed.</p>

<p>“I saw a great cloud sweeping up from under the
horizon, and it was terrible with lightning and loud
thunder. Then it passed over me and rumbled down
the sky and disappeared. And when I awoke and told
my people of my dream, they rejoiced and said:
‘Great things are in store for this youth. We shall
call him the Passing Cloud, and he shall be a thunder
man, keen and quick of thought, with the keenness
and quickness of the lightning; and his name shall
be as thunder in the ears of men.’ And I grew and
believed in these sayings and I was strong. But now
I can see the meaning of the dream&mdash;a great light
and a great noise and a passing.”</p>

<p>The old man sighed, and the light passed out of
his eyes. Then he looked searchingly into the face
of the minister and said, speaking in English:</p>

<p>“You white medicine-man. You pray?”</p>

<p>The minister nodded.</p>

<p>Mahowari turned his gaze to the ground and said
wearily:</p>

<p>“White God dead too, guess.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">XX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NEMESIS OF THE DEUCES</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">FRENCHY called for two cards and reached
for a glass and the bottle. His head swam
dizzily. The clinking of glasses at the bar
smote upon his ears like gongs. He was about to
risk upon one “show-down” the realisation of a five-years’
dream. He felt certain of losing; that was the
strange thing about it. Yet somewhere in the buzzing
back of his head a compelling little devil whispered
and he obeyed.</p>

<p>He drank three big ones straight, and for a moment
things stood still and the buzzing ceased; but
in the sudden silence the hissing of the little devil
increased to a roaring like the river’s in the June
rise. “<i>All on the deuces! All on the deuces!
Every damned cent!</i>” That is what the little devil
in the back of his head was howling now.</p>

<p>“But if I lose it all&mdash;and wanting to go back
home in the spring?” That was the question his
pounding heart hurled at the insistent little devil.</p>

<p>“You won <i>once</i>&mdash;didn’t you&mdash;<i>didn’t you</i>?&mdash;DIDN’T
YOU?” howled back the little devil jeeringly.</p>

<p>“Five hundred,” said Frenchy quietly. His bronze
face had grown livid; his black eyes narrowed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
glittered with a steady stare. With a hand that betrayed
the least perceptible tremor, he pushed the
chips to the centre.</p>

<p>The next man tossed his hand into the discards.
The next hesitated, carefully studying the face of
Frenchy with a furtive lifting of the eyes under his
hat brim; he too laid down his hand.</p>

<p>“Raise you two hundred,” said the next with quiet
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“Two hundred more,” said the next nonchalantly,
drumming a devil’s tattoo with his fingers on the
table.</p>

<p>The fifth drew a long breath, grinned nervously,
showing his teeth like a hungry wolf&mdash;and tossed his
hand into the discards.</p>

<p>It was now up to Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said he, “but did you call me?”</p>

<p>His face had turned a dull, ghastly green, but his
voice was quiet and clear.</p>

<p>“Raised it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” said he, smiling. “Thinking of
something else&mdash;trip home, I guess.” His voice
lowered until it was almost inaudible. This absent-mindedness
was unusual for Frenchy.</p>

<p>An oppressive silence had fallen in the barroom of
the “Big 6.” There was no longer any clinking of
glasses or hum of maudlin voices. The loungers
drew up in a hushed circle about the table and stared
with fascinated eyes. A “big game” was on&mdash;and
it was up to Frenchy. Frenchy was no quitter; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
was a gambler to his finger-tips. “Frenchy? He’d
bet on which’d be the last breath of his dying
mother!” That was the way the popular legend
ran, and the man lived up to it.</p>

<p>“Stake it all&mdash;stake it all on the deuces&mdash;<i>the
deuces</i>&mdash;THE DEUCES!” The little devil in the
back of his head was shrieking now and stamping
red-hot heels into Frenchy’s brain.</p>

<p>“But the trip home&mdash;I’ve planned five years&mdash;&mdash;”
urged his pounding heart.</p>

<p>“You won on them <i>once</i>&mdash;didn’t you?&mdash;<i>didn’t
you</i>?&mdash;DIDN’T YOU?” reiterated the little devil.</p>

<p>Frenchy quietly poured out another glass and
downed it. Then he pulled off his boots, produced
a bunch of bills from the bottom of each, put on his
boots again and looked at his hand.</p>

<p>“Come two thousand more!” he whispered.</p>

<p>A sound of deeper breathing grew up about the fascinated
circle of on-lookers. Frenchy had gone into
his boots&mdash;they knew what that meant. Would the
others stay? <i>Would</i> they?</p>

<p>The place became uncanny with stillness. Nothing
moved in the room. The circle of eyes stared
steadily upon the three who sat with expressionless
faces blanched with the pitiless struggle that was
going on. For a minute that seemed endless the
soundless battle continued. Psychic forces exchanged
invisible sword-thrusts across the table. Nerve
wrestled with nerve that cowered but still fought on.</p>

<p>The whole scene vanished for Frenchy. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to him that he was the centre of a silent hollowness;
only a voice, that was rather an ache felt than a sound
heard, kept up a pitiless jeering.</p>

<p>“They’ll stay&mdash;they’ll stay,” shrieked the little
devil; “your bluff won’t work&mdash;you’re a dead
horse and they’re crows&mdash;crows&mdash;crows!”</p>

<p>“They’re weakening!” beat the heart of Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Deuces&mdash;ha, ha! Deuces! And they’ve both
got face cards&mdash;deuces&mdash;ho, ho!&mdash;going home, eh?&mdash;win
on deuces?&mdash;ho, ho, ho&mdash;deuces!” The insistent
devil laughed spitefully.</p>

<p>“Raise you five hundred more!”</p>

<p>The words echoed and re-echoed in the lonesome
hollowness. Frenchy stared at his cards.</p>

<p>“Five hundred more!”</p>

<p>Frenchy winced and shivered. It seemed to him
that a long, thin-bladed knife had reached out of
the silent hollow that surrounded him and stabbed
him twice in the breast.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho!” went the little devil at the back
of his head. “Stay with ’em! Put up the horses&mdash;everything
on the deuces&mdash;ho, ho, ho!”</p>

<p>“But I can lay down now and save the horses,”
urged the sick heart of Frenchy.</p>

<p>“You won on the deuces <i>once</i>!” shrieked the
little devil; “didn’t you&mdash;DIDN’T YOU?”</p>

<p>Frenchy now heard his own voice growing up out
of the hollow. “Taken: my five horses and outfit
are good for it.”</p>

<p>Then he emerged from the soundless hollow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was aware of the circle of glittering eyes staring
down on the field whereon he had just staked five years
of his life and his last cherished dream.</p>

<p>“Full house&mdash;aces on queens.”</p>

<p>Frenchy heard the words and grinned exultantly.
The little spiteful devil was silent.</p>

<p>“Four kings!”</p>

<p>Frenchy dropped his cards face up and reached for
the bottle. “Ho, ho, ho!” went the little devil,
dancing all over his brain; “everything lost on the
deuces&mdash;dead horse for the crows to pick!&mdash;he, he,
he!”</p>

<p>A ripple of exclamations ran about the circle of
loungers as they leaned forward to see the hand
upon which Frenchy had staked all that he owned.</p>

<p>“Deuces! By the jumping&mdash;four dirty deuces!”</p>

<p>“<i>Deuces?</i>”</p>

<p>“Four of ’em.”</p>

<p>“How’s that for a bluff?”</p>

<p>“Fool play!”</p>

<p>A buzzing undertone of comment filled the room
and steadily grew into a chattering as of crows about
a spot where something has just died. Frenchy
seemed not to hear; he was busy filling and refilling
glasses. The man with the four kings quietly raked
in his winnings. “And the horses&mdash;&mdash;?” he suggested.</p>

<p>Frenchy set the drained glass down with a bang,
and with a snake-like forward thrusting of the head
leered hideously at the winner. “<i>Can’t you shut up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
about the horses?</i>” He forced the words menacingly
through his shut teeth.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the loungers as they looked
upon the pinched, malignant face with the upper lip
lifted quiveringly and the close-set teeth showing
beneath. This was no longer the Frenchy of legend;
that Frenchy had always been known as one who lost
or won large sums with the utter nervelessness of a
machine. This was no longer the face of Frenchy&mdash;the
gay, careless, haughty face of him who flirted
with Fortune. This was a new Frenchy&mdash;a terrible
Frenchy; with a coiled snake lurking just behind
each glittering eyeball. This face sent a shiver
through the crowd&mdash;like the sight of an ugly knife
unsheathed in anger.</p>

<p>The loungers with affected carelessness began to
move away. With a lightning sweep of the hands
Frenchy drew his guns and banged them down violently
on the table before him. “Stay where you are,
gentlemen!” he said; “I’m going to talk and I want
an audience. When I’m done talking, I’m off on the
long trail and the first man that moves goes with
me!”</p>

<p>There had always been a winsome something in
the voice of the man. It was now commanding, irresistible.
The loungers stood still and stared dumbfounded
upon this terrible new version of an old
legend.</p>

<p>Frenchy picked up four cards from his hand and
held them up fanwise before his enforced listeners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
“Look at ’em!” he shouted hoarsely. “Look at
’em! Let ’em burn through your hides into your
souls! Oh, you don’t see anything, eh? Don’t one of
you dare to grin!”</p>

<p>One hand fumbled nervously with the guns.</p>

<p>“What do you see? I say, what do you see? Four
deuces? That all? I’ll tell you what <i>I</i> see. I see
the red, warm hearts of two friends! I see diamonds
that are cheap beside such hearts! I see a club&mdash;a
black, brutal, treacherous club&mdash;that struck down a
friend! And I see the devil’s spades that dug his
grave! That’s what I see! Look hard!”</p>

<p>Frenchy seemed to exercise an uncanny influence
over his hearers. Not one moved&mdash;all stared upon
the four upheld deuces.</p>

<p>“It’s the devil’s story, gentlemen,” he continued
in a low, husky voice. “It’s hung by me for three
bloody years&mdash;it haunts me! I’ve got to tell it.”</p>

<p>He passed his free hand over his forehead beaded
with sweat. Then he whispered a question to the
spellbound audience:</p>

<p>“Did any of you know the Kid&mdash;Kid Smith?”</p>

<p>A momentary expression of infinite kindness softened
the face of Frenchy, only to give way immediately
to deep quivering lines of anguish. He continued
tremulously.</p>

<p>“I knew him&mdash;the Kid. Had the biggest, bravest
heart that ever beat in the God-forsaken white
spaces of a map. One of that breed of fellows that
the world nails to its crosses&mdash;the Kid was. And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
were friends; that is, he was a friend. He gave and
I took, and he was happier in the giving than I in
the taking. That’s the way it always goes: one
gives and one takes&mdash;and God pity the man that only
takes!</p>

<p>“Why did I bet on the deuces? Oh, the damned,
dirty deuces! Don’t I know the game? By God, I
know every card like a kid knows his mother’s face!
Didn’t I know it was the last ditch for me and no
hope? I tell you, gentlemen, I didn’t play ’em. The
Devil played ’em for me&mdash;the black Devil of the
dirty deuces with the fiery feet that have been kicking
me hellward for three aching years!</p>

<p>“Look at the cards! Look at ’em! There’s
blood on every one of ’em, and they stink with the
writhing flesh of a friend in the flames!”</p>

<p>Frenchy took another drink and his manner
changed. The violence of his delirious outburst gave
way to quietness. He spoke in a low, penetrating
voice, and the black flame of his eyes held his hearers.</p>

<p>“The Kid and I had been riding across a big
stretch of brown grass for two days, and our tongues
were thick with thirst. I remember how he gave
me the last drops of water we had with us, cussing
and damning a man who got thirsty. ‘I can go
without water with the biggest camel that ever stuck
a hoof into the sand,’ said he. And I took the water;
I always took and the Kid was always giving.</p>

<p>“And along in the evening we struck a little
water hole and camped. How the Kid did drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
when he thought I wasn’t looking! Oh, he wasn’t
such a camel for carrying water with him! It was
his big heart that carried the water&mdash;the sweet, pure,
sparkling waters of friendship.</p>

<p>“Along about sundown a dull grey cloud grew up
in the west&mdash;smoke! But the wind was against it,
blowing soft and dry from the east where the river
lay thirty miles away. ‘Think we’d better ride on?’
says the Kid. But I was tired and wanted sleep,
and the Kid gave in. Says he, ‘Horses need a rest,
I guess’; didn’t lay it onto me, you know. Giving
again, and I taking.</p>

<p>“So we lariated the horses and rolled in. Do you
know how a man sleeps after he’s been burning dry
for days and fills up at last? I plunged into ten
thousand fathoms of soft, soft sleep&mdash;deep, deep
down, where the cool sweet dreams bloom in worlds
of crystal. And everywhere in my sleep there were
bubbling springs and I drank and drank and drank,
and every gulp was sweeter than the last.</p>

<p>“Then the dreams changed and the many bubbling
water holes of sleep went dry, and fine hot dust
sprayed up out of the chinks where the water had
flowed. Then the wind of sleep grew hot and hotter.
It scorched my face and sent thin needles of fire
into my brain. And then I was standing up coughing
and rubbing my eyes and the Kid was beside
me. What did we see?</p>

<p>“The wind had veered about while we slept. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
hell was climbing up the west and a booming wind
swept howling devils through the smoky twilight.
Above the unnatural dawn, long black ragged arms
reached out into the zenith and cloaked the stars. I
heard a horse snorting and tugging at his lariat.</p>

<p>“‘Good God, Kid!’ I wheezed; ‘let’s be off!’</p>

<p>“The Kid turned his face upon me and smiled&mdash;that
slow, brave smile haunts me night and day.</p>

<p>“‘Your horse is gone&mdash;&mdash;’ He waved his hand
toward the miles of dark that stretched toward the
river. ‘Pulled his stake just before you woke
up; heard him go.’ The Kid’s voice didn’t even
tremble.</p>

<p>“‘Quick!’ I yelled; ‘the matches! Start a back
fire!’</p>

<p>“Then a big, cold hand gripped my heart; the
Kid had given me the last match that day; I had
wanted to smoke.</p>

<p>“All hell behind us and a horse for two! A thirty-mile
heat with the mustangs of the Devil, and double
weight to carry! It made me sick&mdash;dizzy sick. I
forgot everything. Oh, gentlemen, when you face
hell fire you’ll know if your mother bore a coward.</p>

<p>“For a minute we stared into the west&mdash;a minute
years long. Big pink waves of smoke rolled into
gulfs of purple and disappeared into holes of murk.
Above, the blood-red surf frothed and sparkled and
fell in yellow showers! Great blankets of dense
gloom dropped from the sky and smothered out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the hellish morning, hurling momentary night down
the howling wind! Then keen zigzag blades of
fire ripped through the belly of the night!</p>

<p>“I felt the Kid’s hand grasp mine. O God! the
feel of his hand! ‘One horse for two, Frenchy,’ he
said, quiet as a man who proposes another drink at
the bar. ‘One of us makes a run for his life; and
the other&mdash;&mdash;’ He motioned carelessly toward Hell.
‘One more deal of the cards, Frenchy, and the last
for one of us. High hand takes the horse; low hand&mdash;produce
the deck.’</p>

<p>“I produced the deck&mdash;greasy and dog-eared; for
many’s the social game the Kid and I had played
with ’em together. We squatted on the prairie in
the red twilight, and the Kid dealt. Not a tremor
of his perfect gambler’s hands! Cool as though it
was a game of penny ante.</p>

<p>“I drew three deuces! <i>Deuces!</i> Oh, the damned,
dirty deuces!</p>

<p>“‘How many?’ says the Kid pleasantly. For
the first time in my life I forgot to guard my hand.
A deep rolling thunder had grown up out of the
burning west. It seemed I could feel the prairies
tremble like a bridge under a drove of sheep. ‘Listen!’
I gasped. ‘It’s the critters coming,’ said the
Kid; ‘cattle and buffalo and elk and deer and
wolves&mdash;the whole posse. How many cards did
you call for?&mdash;<i>two</i>, wasn’t it?’</p>

<p>“He thrust two cards into my hand. One of ’em
was the deuce of hearts! O God! It wasn’t only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the printed heart he gave me; it was the warm, red,
beating heart of a friend.”</p>

<p>Frenchy dropped his head into his arms on the
table and groaned. When he lifted his face again
his eyes were wet.</p>

<p>“Four deuces&mdash;and they burn holes in the dark
whenever I shut my eyes! And all day I see four
pairs of devils dancing in the sunlight till my head
swims!”</p>

<p>Frenchy dropped his head upon his chest and
breathed deep, uneven breaths for a space.</p>

<p>“The Kid had only a pair of face-cards,” he continued;
“a dinky little pair of face-cards. And for
a second the man in me came to the surface, and I
threw the four hand down and stamped on it and
said I wouldn’t leave him. And what did the Kid
do? Began with all the blackguard adjectives of
the language and ended with ‘coward’ and threw
the bunch in my teeth. ‘You’re the first man that
ever called me a quitter, Frenchy,’ he said. ‘I played
my hand, didn’t I? What would you do to a man
who’d ask you to take your money back when you’d
lost? If I’d won, do you think I wouldn’t leave
your carcass here to stew, you cussed fool?’</p>

<p>“And then something in the back of my head
woke up and howled: ‘You won&mdash;it’s yours&mdash;a
chance for life&mdash;fair play&mdash;he’d go if you lost&mdash;he’d
go!’ And there was a roaring in my head and
the flaming night whirled ’round, and the bitter words
stung me, and my heart hardened&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“I found the Kid’s horse saddled and bridled. I
cut the lariat and leaped astride. I jabbed the spike
spurs into the frightened brute till he roared with
pain. I had forgotten everything. I was a Fear
without a body flying through a darkness that
coughed smoke and spit light. And then at last
things quit whirling, and I felt the steady <i>lift, lift,
lift</i> of the good brute racing with all the devils down
a heart-breaking stretch for the river.</p>

<p>“I turned about in the saddle. Half the sky
had turned into an open furnace! Above me a great
stormy ocean of blood rolled on into the twilight
of the east! Blood!&mdash;a seething, billowy sea of red
blood, with great, red, purring cat-tongues lapping
it greedily! Gaudy giant flowers&mdash;purple, yellow,
red, green&mdash;bloomed for a moment in a strange garden
of dreams, and nodded in the wind and fell and
bloomed again and fell! The infernal beauty of the
thing fascinated me for a moment. Then I heard
the rumbling&mdash;the unceasing thunder. It was louder
than before. I thought of the ten thousand sharp
hoofs gaining, gaining, with whips of fire lashing
them in the rear. And then I thought of the Kid
back there.</p>

<p>“My heart sickened. The hot wind that scorched
my face accused me; the choking air accused me. I
could see him lying on his face even then with the
mad hoofs beating him into a pulp; I could see the
writhing of his body as the heat increased; I could
smell the stench of his sizzling flesh!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reeled in the saddle, yet the mad wish to live
lashed my hands to the pommel. But this was only
for a moment. The meanest worm that ever wriggled
in a dunghill holds fast to his life. I forgot the
Kid again; I remembered only myself and that I
must ride to win. I pulled the horse down and held
him steady. Never did I throw a leg across a better
horse than the Kid’s&mdash;honest, rangy, clean-limbed
and deep in the chest! My heart leaped with joy
when I heard his long even breathing. I had a great
delirious love for the big-hearted brute as I felt
his long, even reach, the tireless rhythmic stride that
throws the miles behind. The drifting red sea of
smoke above cast the wild glare down upon the prairie
and made the footing sure. I threw my guns
away; I stripped off my coat and gave it to the wind.
I knew what an extra pound might mean.</p>

<p>“An elk forged slowly past, his wide antlers
tipped with light. An antelope sprang up and
bounded away into the twilight ahead. A coyote
leaped from a shoe-string clump; he cowered and
whined like a whipped dog with his tail between his
legs, then raced away down the wind. Snorting
shadows began to move to right and left in the
further gloom and disappear in the smoke-drift. I
was now a part of the ragged edge of the flotsam
tossed up by the approaching lip of the flood. I
gave my horse another inch of rein and held him
steady. The thunder in the rear grew louder; I
could hear dimly the wild confusion of animal cries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
I was the fox hearing the yelp of the hounds and
racing for cover.</p>

<p>“Years and years of flight with the breath of an
oven to breathe! Years and years of rising and
falling, rising and falling, and my throat was tight
with the driving smoke. The good brute began to
wheeze and cough. I felt the tremor of his wearying
muscles, the slight unsteadiness of the knees.
I prayed for the river&mdash;prayed like a kid at his
mother’s knee. I begged the brute to keep his legs;
I cursed him when he tottered; I called him baby
names and damned him in a breath.</p>

<p>“And after years the day began&mdash;a sneaking
shadow of a day, shamed out by the howling western
dawn that met it on the run. A storm of sound was
all about me. Neck and neck I raced with a buffalo
bull that led the herd; his swollen tongue hung from
his foaming mouth; his breath rumbled in his throat.
Wheezing steers toiled up about me. Deer and elk
raced side by side, slowly forging into the van. Grey
wolves bounded past, whining and yelping. And my
good brute beat away bravely at the few remaining
miles. I felt the dry rasp of his lungs and the breaking
of his big, strong heart. He stumbled&mdash;I gave
him the spur to the heel; he gave no sign of pain.
He was dying on his feet.</p>

<p>“And the cheap, dirty day crept in through the
smoke&mdash;and I thought of the Kid, and lost heart
and cared no more about the race. But by and by I
saw the river ahead, and we plunged in&mdash;a howling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
panting flood of beasts, struggling for the farther
shore.</p>

<p>“The sky and the river whirled about me. I
felt my horse totter up a sandbank and fall. Then
the day went out, and I forgot.</p>

<p>“O God! I wish I’d never waked up! Why
didn’t the buffalo and the steers beat me into the
sand? Why did I wake up?”</p>

<p>Frenchy covered his face with his hands and the
tears trickled through his fingers.</p>

<p>“But the dead horse parted the herd, and I woke
up and the fire was dead and the sun looked like a
moon through the smoke. Three aching years ago,
it was; and I’ve dragged my carcass about and tried
to look like a man. But night and day the deuces
have followed me and tortured me. They burn
holes in the dark whenever I shut my eyes; four
pairs of devils dance before me all day in the sunlight
till my head whirls.”</p>

<p>Frenchy picked up the four deuces and held them
tremblingly before the staring crowd.</p>

<p>“Look at ’em! Let ’em burn through your hides
into your souls! There’s the blood of the Kid on
’em. The damned dirty deuces! They’ve got me
in the last ditch! I’m done!”</p>

<p>Frenchy crushed the cards and dashed them to the
floor. He arose unsteadily to his feet, took his guns
and staggered out of the barroom of the “Big 6.”</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
